Join the discussion
===================

You can get in contact with the Cuckoo developers and users through
the official mailing list kindly provided by The Honeynet Project or
on IRC at the official #cuckoosandbox channel.

Our mailing list is mostly intended for development discussions and
sharing of ideas and bug reports. If you are encountering an issue you
can't solve and are looking for some help, go to our Community
website.

Please read the following rules before posting:

   * Before posting, read the mailing list archives, the Cuckoo
     blog, the documentation and Google about your issue. **DO NOT**
     post questions that have already been answered over and over
     everywhere.

   * Posting messages saying just something like "Doesn't work, help
     me" are completely useless. If something is not working report
     the error, paste the logs, the config file, the information on
     the virtual machine, the results of the troubleshooting, etc.
     Give context. We are not wizards and we don't have a crystal
     ball.

   * Use a proper title. Stuff like "Doesn't work", "Help me",
     "Error" are not proper titles.

   * Try to use pastebin.com, pastie.org or similar services to
     paste logs and configs: makes the message more readable.

   * **The community website uses Markdown syntax**. So please read
     the Markdown documentation before posting.
