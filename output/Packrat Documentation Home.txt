                        About Packrat
 
Packrat was a NODNetwork Operations Division iTime project designed to simplify and automate creating Listening Posts using open source and COTSCommercial Off-The-Shelf software.  Packrat starts with a hardened Operating System baseline and configures additional service hardening (Apache, DNS, etc) depending on the LPListening Post software.
The basic tenants of Packrat are:

Hardened-by-default Operating System
Must facilitate < 20 minute LPListening Post deployment per LP
Must facilitate <10 minute LPListening Post maintenance per LP

COTS/Open Source Tools Used

Ansible: http://github.com/ansible/ansible
Packer: packer.io
VMWare Workstation 10: vmware.com

Basic Workflow

Required software installed on DEVLAN workstation: Packer, VMWare Workstation 10
Packer configuration created
SSH public/private keypair created
Kickstart (w/ updated SSHSecure Shell public key, root password, and (if needed) network configuration)
Run Packer to provision and create hardened base LPListening Post VM
(Optional) Create Ansible playbook to configure LPListening Post software (i.e. Sandshark LPListening Post)
(Optional) Run Ansible-playbook to perform LPListening Post configuration

FAQs

Why are the Ansible playbook steps optional?  Packer recently introduced an Ansible Local provisioner which means Packer can run Ansible after the initial kickstart process has completed.  Currently, NODNetwork Operations Division uses Ansible Playbook mode instead of Ansible Local so that the playbook is never saved on the LP.
