Building tinc on Linux
Specifically on Ubuntu 14.04. But should be similar anywhere
 
Install dependencies
tinc requires OpenSSL, zlib and lzo to compile.
 
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev zlib1g-dev liblzo2-dev build-essential automake autoconf gettext texinfo
 
Build
autoreconf -fsi
./confgiure
make
 
Installing
By default, when you build tinc from source, tinc will install itself into /usr/local/. tinc will then look for its configuration in /usr/local/etc/tinc
make install
