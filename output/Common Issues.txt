Getting Started with DART
NOTE: The instructions below are kinda outdated.  For more up to date info, go to the EDG Leafbag Project on Stash
 
Download the Fedora 18 VMVirtual Machine from \\FS-01\Share\Dart\Virtual Machines\Linux (not required if you have a linux X64 machine you already like).
Import the ova file into VMWare Workstation by double clicking it.
user name and password for fedora vm = tester, 123ABCdef.
 
Download VSphere client – the latest version is 5.5 which is available on \\fs-01\share\Windows Applications\VMware\VMware vCenter Server 5.5.0 U2\vSphere-Client\VMware-viclient.exe
(Note: If Windows 8/8.1 complains about .Net Framework 3.5 not being installed you need the OSOperating System installation media and then to run this command: DISM /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:NetFx3 /All /LimitAccess /Source:<INSTALL MEDIA PATH>\sources\sxs)
You can also use the "Connect to remote server" option with VMWare 10 to connect as well!
login information for VSphere:
Addr: (10.9.0.10) Dart-vcenter.devlan.net (Currently use the IP address listed!)
  user: root
  pass: 123ABCdef.   <- Notice there is a period at the end!
 
If you're using Ubuntu and don't have mercurial installed, you'll need to pull it down.  There are devlan repositories for Ubuntu available here http://repo.devlan.net/.  Instructions for setting them up are here http://wiki.devlan.net/wiki/doku.php?id=network:mirrors:ubuntu&s=ubuntu.  Use the lsb_relase -a  linux command to get the Codename used for editing /etc/apt/sources.list  (e.g.  12.04 is "precise").   Anything after Essential Packages is optional.    Not all packages are needed (e.g. subversion), use your discretion.
Once your repositories are setup run:
sudo apt-get install git
 
From here follow the directions found here: EDG Leafbag Project on Stash
