F-Secure
SECRET//NOFORN
 
F-Secure is a PSPPersonal Security Product (Anti-Virus) vendor headquartered in Helsinki, Finland.  In OSB's experience, F-Secure has generally been a lower tier product that causes us minimal difficulty.  The only annoyance we have observed is that F-Secure has an apparent entropy-based heuristic that flags Trojaned applications or other binaries containing encrypted/compressed payloads.  Two defeats are known to exist:  On involves using RARFile compression algorithm file string tables in the resource section, the other involves cloning a RARFile compression algorithm file manifest file – the manifest technique also works against Avira's entropy-based heuristics.
