Cytolysis-1h HG v3.1.6 Test Plan
Test Plan for Cytolysis-1h v3.1.6

Review open EARs for HG, in particular for the capabilties used in this CONOP
Review test report and other documentation provided by Xetron with delivery
Review HG commands document for capabilties used in this CONOP
Confirm OSOperating System on ICON machine with Operator - complete - Debian 8.2

HG Base -
Install - complete - test 1
IAC attack via admin subnet flux node
Use remote to upload HG via admin subnet flux node
Establish CTCounter Terrorism connection by triggering admin IP of DUT, call back via HTTPSHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure to external web server flux node
Record CPU and memory impacts throughout, verify no syslogs, traps or other alerting behavior


Uninstall - complete test 2
Uninstall HG using CTCounter Terrorism command
Collect "show tech" and other info (look for assists on linecards)
Reload
Collect "show tech" and other info
After install, uninstall by just reloading deviceCollect  "show tech" and other info

After intsall, uninstall by hard reset of deviceCollect  "show tech" and other info



Restart HG modules from CTCounter Terrorism session - complete test 3, 6
Verify no syslogs, traps or other alerting behavior
Verify functionality of modules


CT session - HTTPSHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure comms only - complete Test 7
Verify CTCounter Terrorism session functionality using different hosts to impersonate
Capture and review wireshark of CTCounter Terrorism session establishment and operation
Test what logs are produced when trigger sent with incorrect sequence number - show snmp output, syslogs, prints to console, snmp traps, access-lists
Test impersonation of hosts from different VLANs




Sup Failover Testing - Complete Test 11
Verify state after failover
Install on one SUP and then force failover through IOSApple operating system for small devices command
Install on one SUP and then test crash to cause failover to other SUP
Install on one SUP and then pull active SUP module to cause failover to other SUP


Instlal on new SUPfail back to original and re-install

Fail back to original and re-install


ACE - complete - test 9
Enter all commands foreseen during op, variety of show commands
Boundary testing - test entering commands that don't exist, typos
Enter unsupported non-show commands
Verify command history - show history, show history all
Verify no syslogs, traps or other alerting behavior


SMITE - focus on options -ac -sm -t - complete Test 12
test that rules can be created/deleted/enabled/disabled with all parameters expected during op - timed rule, max times to affect, max per host
test creating multiple rules at a time
Test creating a rule that targets multiple source hosts to single destination as well as single source to single destination
test that filterbroker can be restarted with active rules, with rules that are inactive, new rules can be entered after restart
test iframe/exploitation of target
Verify that counters increment in CTCounter Terrorism show commands related to SMITE
Run wireshark on target and examen output of SIMTE session
Verify no syslogs, DNSDomain Name System queries or SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol Traps sent during Iframe
verify iframe not injected for traffic that does not match SMITE rule - from other hosts, from target host to different destination, traffic to other ports (test 443)
Use SMITE while pps threshold is reached - this no longer relevant, no assist.
Verify that traffic from other hosts that are not targeted in SMITE rule is not impacted by SMITE rule


ARP survey - complete Test 8
Verify results of socket get_arp_survey_data output
Verify no syslogs, traps or other alerting behavior


Tunnel - complete Test 10
Establish Tunnel to host not on VLANVirtual Local Area Network 2 or VLANVirtual Local Area Network 19, calling back via HTTPSHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure comms
Verify CTCounter Terrorism Tunnel show commands
Attempt to run nmap against VLANVirtual Local Area Network 19 subnet
Test impersonating different hosts for tunnel traffic
Teardown tunnel - both normal and abnormal termination
Re-establish tunnel
Test pps limitation - tunnel teardown due to pps threshold reached
Test tunnel behavior when TAPVirtual Network kernel device IP becomes active on network
Test tunnel timeout parameter
Test triggering as well as tun init 
Verify no syslogs, traps or other alerting behavior
Collect and analyze wireshark of tunnel establishment and activity


Performance Testing - Characterize CPU impact of capabilties - underway
Establish Baselines for low, medium, high traffic levels
impact of Tunnel at each level
impact of SMITE at each level


OPSEC Testing - completed in previous testing
On-device
Compare output of show tech without HG, with HG, and after HG uninstall
Test Crash DUT


On-net - review wireshark of CTCounter Terrorism session and Tunnel session


Smoke Test - complete
Redirection - test15
Packet Collection test16
DIVRT - complete test 14


Ad-hoc Testing - completed in previous testing
line cards being taken out/added/reloaded
loss of ICON connectivity during HG install
changing/adding to NATNetwork Address Translation configuration
explico


MTU changes since hopping through so many flux nodes
IAC and HG re-attack
Perform system admin commands
Add latency
Run Stack Scrambler
reload device during HG install
perform system admin during HG upload
Impact to SP and linecard CPU
input queue buffer checks
test RAA assists dropped when HG uninstalled
test RAA dropped when packet assist threshold exceeded
verify if assist for flux 4 ip is present during CTCounter Terrorism session
Verify that impersonated host can still get to flx 4 ip and other places
verify assist is dropped once max number of matches occur on smite rule, or time duration expires
Verify CPU impact and impact to other hosts who are browsing to a SMITE rule destination, but do not match smite rule
