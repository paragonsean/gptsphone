Winhex
Winhex is a hex editor and lightweight forensics utility for Windows.  The tool is free for evaluation purposes, but has several limitations if not licensed.
Our most up to date license currently on the share is a 3-user license for Winhex 16.1.  If anyone is aware of a more up to date license, please update the page.
A 64-bit version is apparently available, but we do not currently have a copy on the share.
