2. Source Control
SECRET//NOFORN
 
AED has recently moved towards using Git for source control and uses it for all projects.  We won’t go too in depth here because there is a better resource on confluence that can be found Git Tutorials  .  There are a few things to go over though:

I highly recommend going to FIN or 4STAR and navigating to http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/

Read about Git Flow, the workflow we have begun to adopt in OSB, which can be found Git Workflows  .
Take a look around stash.devlan.net, you’ll get a chance to see some of the many projects that AEDApplied Engineering Devision has going on.

 
Setting up GIT:

Navigate to the share \\fs-01\Share\Windows Software Development Resources\git
Install the latest GIT: Git-X.X.X-previewX.exe
Install the latest SourceTree: SourceTreeSetup_X.X.X.exe
(OPTIONAL) Install TortoiseGit (if you like nice pretty green checkmarks or simply as an alternative to SourceTree: 


Generate GITSource code management software ssh-keypair:
Open GITSource code management software bash (recently installed)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C YOUR_DEVLAN_USERNAME@devlan.net -b 4096



 
As stated earlier, we use the workflow outlined in Git Flow and I wanted to highlight some key things.  Git Flow is a fancy way of saying we follow a branching model that uses specific names.  The branches are as follows:

Master: Official releases, commits to this are tied to software available for use.
Develop: Latest stable code.  This code should be ready to be released at any given time and means it should be bug free.
Feature/<BranchName>: This is where you get to play.  Feature branches tend to belong to a single developer and should be focused on a specific requirement.  Feature branches can be in any state.
Hotfix: A branch off of Master that is meant to fix a specific small problem out of the traditional development cycle.

This brings us to our first new developer exercise:  OSB Workflow In Git  .
