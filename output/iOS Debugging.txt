Step-by-step guide

In Stash, go to the "IOS" project.

Click on the button on the left side to create a repository. Only certain people have permission to do this, so you may need to ask one of them to do this and some of the following steps.
Under "Settings"â€“>"Workzone", select "Enable" for "Unapprove outgoing pull request".
At a command line, perform the following steps to create an initial empty master branch to which default reviewers can be assigned.
cd <your IOSApple operating system for small devices repo directory>
git clone ssh://git@stash.devlan.net:7999/ios/<proj_name>.giT
cd <proj_name>
git commit --allow-empty -m "first commit"
git push


In Stash, have someone with permission add default reviewers to the new master branch.
