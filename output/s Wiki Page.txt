Funny Code post from 2014.


The DARTTest-Software (commercial) vSphere client installer does not default to English prompts, if you have the Chinese language pack installed.  I do not speak Chinese. The installer annoyling does this even, if the current locale is set to English e.g. set to use English. Now by design the installer's locale can be forced to use English with the following command line option: VMware-viclient.exe -locale en_US
Unfortunate the install will fail when this option is specified. Thanks to User #73580 my tip of the day is in Chinese these characters 英语 means English.
