Build Python 3.4 on Debian/Ubuntu
I prefer to install python to /opt/python34 instead of /usr/local. Just make sure to update your path to include /opt/python34/bin and add /opt/python34/lib to your LD path, or edit the prefix argument in the configure statement below. This would also work on Ubuntu.
 
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libncursesw5 libncursesw5-dev libbz2-dev libgdbm-dev liblzma-dev tk-dev valgrind
tar zxvf Python-3.4.3.tgz
cd Python-3.4.3
./configure --enable-shared --enable-loadable-sqlite-extensions --enable-ipv6 \
            --with-system-ffi --with-system-expat --with-signal-module --with-threads --with-valgrind \
	        --with-fpectl --with-ensurepip --prefix=/opt/python34
make && make install
As Root:
echo "/opt/python34/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/python34.conf
ldconfig
 
As an alternate to the post-build step of changing the LD path, one can, at the ./configure step, specify the following additional parameter (e.g., after the "–prefix=/opt/python34" parameter):
LDFLAGS="-Wl,--rpath=<value given for --prefix>/lib"
this will burn the necessary path into the binary during the build step, and things should just "work" (assuming correct update to $PATH, of course)

True. It was installed by default on my fresh Debian 7 install, but it definitely wasn't a minimal install.

you may want to add valgrind to the apt-get install
