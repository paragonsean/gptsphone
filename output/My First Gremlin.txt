Deployment Interface
Plans are defined as a list of jobs that After Midnight should execute on a target. A target has a single plan running at a given time. These plans are made available to the target via Core through a beacon to a web server. The am tool generates a deploy directory that is made available through the web server.
 
Deploy Directory
The deploy directory is generated and modified when the user use the commit or remove functions of the am command.
Structure
/<workspace>/deploy/<target url>/<plan_files>
Where workspace is the workspace the am tool was performing on. <target url> is defined when creating a target configuration in the am command, which can manually be specified, or auto-generated. <plan_files> are a number of files that are automatically generated when the am commit command is run.
Plan Files
A plan consists of a single index file, and a variable number of data blobs that are referred to from the index file.
The Index File
An index file follows the following format.
 


Byte Offset
Field


0x000
32-bit Index Serial



0x008
64-bit Uninstall FILETIME



0x010
32-bit Beacon Interval



0x018
32-bit Jitter



0x020
32-bit Dead Man Delay



0x028
256-bit  LP Key



0x068
256-bit Plan Hash



0x108
32-bit Plan Length



0x108
plan_data[Plan Length] = [ [ 64-bit ID,  64-bit action, 256-bit hash ],  ... ]


 
 
The LPListening Post key is a randomly generated key for the target that is used for encrypting data written to disk on target. This key does not exist on the target until the index file is retrieved. The index file is encrypted using the target's public certificate. The index's file name is predetermined and burned into the target build. The data started at 0x80 is a list of gremlin blobs information for the target. The gremlin blob information includes the unique ID of the blob, the action to be taken with the blob, and the sha256 hash of the blob which is also its file name on disk.
