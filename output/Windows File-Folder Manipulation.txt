Miscellaneous Module
Stash Repository: Miscellaneous Library

Module Name: MISCDirectoryCreator_NTV (Native APIApplication Programming Interface)
 
Module Description: This module allows for the creation of parent directories as well as allowing for creation of a directory with attributes. Using the Native APIApplication Programming Interface you can use the exposed function CreateDirectoryWithAttributes to give attributes to create a new directory with attributes. The other exposed functions allow for the creation of a directory and all missing parent directories (recursive directory creation). For example, if I want to create the directory C:\test\test2\test3 when neither C:\test nor C:\test2 exist. Using CreateRecursiveDirectoryFromPath will cause the creation of C:\test, C:\test\test2, and C:\test\test2\test3.
 
Usage: 
BOOL CreateRecurisveDirectoryFromFilePath(WCHAR *wcFilePath, DWORD dwAttribs = FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL);
 
wcFilePath: Path to a file. All missing parent directories will be created.
dwAttribs: Attributes to be given to the directories created. Default to FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL.
Returns TRUE when successful.
 
BOOL CreateRecursiveDirectoryFromPath(WCHAR *wcDirectoryPath, DWORD dwAttribs = FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL);
 
wcFilePath: Path to a folder. This directory and all missing parent directories will be created.
dwAttribs: Attributes to be given to the directories created. Default to FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL.
Returns TRUE when successful.
 
BOOL CreateDirectoryWithAttributes(WCHAR * wcDirectoryPath, DWORD dwAttribs);
 
wcFilePath: Path to a directory to be created
dwAttribs: Attributes to be given to the directory created.
Returns TRUE when successful.
 
PSP/OS Issues: No known issues
 
('excerpt' missing)
 
Sharing Level: Unilateral
 
Technique Origin: In-house
 
Notes: 

Uses the Native APIApplication Programming Interface - Wrapper around NTCreateFile
Only creates directories - never creates files
Function CreateRecursiveDirectoryFromFilePath now works with alternate data streams. Example: C:\TestDirectory:MyFile.dll will cause the creation of TestDirectory (as a directory) if it is not already present.

 
Module Specific Structures: N/A
 
Module Return Codes: Boolean return value (TRUE == SUCCESS)
 
Example Code:
 
	//Create multiple directories above a file
	MISCDirectoryCreator_NTV dcCreate;
	BOOL bCreated = dcCreate.CreateRecurisveDirectoryFromFilePath(L"C:\\TestDir\\Making\\ANew\\Directory\\file.txt");
 
	//Create missing directories
	bRet = dcCreate.CreateRecursiveDirectoryFromPath(L"C:\\Windows\\temp\\test2\\test3");
 
	//Create with attributes
	bRet = dcCreate.CreateDirectoryWithAttributes(L"C:\\Windows\\temp2", FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN|FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM);
