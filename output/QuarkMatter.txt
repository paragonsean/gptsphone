look into using the Vagrantfile to script out your setup on a base Ubuntu VM. in the docs, the section you want is probably (off the top of my head) "Provisioning".

I ended up moving the information for this page to Setting Up a Linux Build Environment for EFI  , for those interested. I've looked into how to use Vagrant to do those tasks, but haven't quite figured it out yet.

this sounds like a job for Vagrant!
