Windows symbol server
https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols works now on DEVLAN. This should now "just work" for tools like Ida Pro and Windbg.
 
Setting symbol path in windbg:
.sympath srv*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
or
Set your _NT_SYMBOL_PATH to srv*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
 
The symbol repository is located on the share at \\fs-01\share\WindowsSymbols. If you find its missing symbols that you need, consider Updating the Windows Symbol share via the Internet  .
