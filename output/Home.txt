Single Bus Theory
 

The question you must ask yourself EVERY DAY:  
If your physical form were forcibly displaced from the space-time in which it occupied, by the sudden and urgent presence of a large commuter bus, would all the development work, ideas, and knowledge that you have contributed to the organization continue to be useful or even AVAILABLE?
 
Why is that so?   What have you done today to preserve that information?

If I'm dead, I'm the poor bastard.  I can spare no pity for those left behind when I'm dead in the ground

LOL, but what about those poor bastards that have to pick up where you left off after you take it to the grave?  I guess they're left to fend for themselves...

My thoughts, ideas, work and knowledge are all my own and nobody else's
