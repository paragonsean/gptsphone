Welcome
This page is to try and collect information that is useful for someone coming onboard.  Once this gets fleshed out a bit more, it will be moved out of my personal space and into the general wiki.
Useful DevLan locations:

"\\fs-01\home"  This is where you can create a (semi-sorta, but not really) home directory for yourself
"\\fs-01\share"  This is the everything repo.
"\\fs-01\share\Windows Software Development Resources"  This is where you will find software necessary for doing things such as setting up a dev environment
"\\fs-01\share\Windows Applications"  This is where various applications, etc (e.g., nasm) reside
"\\fs-01\share\WindowsSymbols"  Where the symbols for Windows reside.  The maintainer(s) & maintenance intervals are currently unknown.

Useful Links:


DEVLAN Resources   – links, etc.  A mini home page for DEVLAN
 "https://confluence.devlan.net/dashboard.action"  This is the wiki's home page.  You should already know this if you are reading this.
