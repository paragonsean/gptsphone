**NOTE: AngerMangement repo project contains multiple git projects
Components of AngerManagement 

('image' missing)
 
AngerManagement repo project contains multiple git projects where the goal is to output an executable that builds the necessary plugins for Mission Control (MC) to target a particular Android mobile device. This executable is a python zip file called angerquake, but in the future, it will be renamed to angermanagement to fit with the naming convention of all the plugins. The reason why it's called angerquake is because the first plugin incorporated was Dugtrio, and as a Pokemon, Dugtrio's ability is to quake; therefore, it is named angerquake. 
To build a Mission Control Server based on the output of AngerManagement, please see the section "How to Build Mission Control Server using AngerManagement."
To understand what exploits we integrate with AngerManagement (remote exploit, privilege escalation, information leak, etc), please see Android Exploits and Techniques
 
Plugins / Components:
Enumeration Stage Plugins

Androidua - A plugin that produces a device enumeration by parsing the browser user agent (UA) to include the device and build info, OS, platform, webkit version, and browser name and version. Written in Python. 


Information Leak Stage Plugins - To do: define!

Dugtrio info leak


Access Stage Plugins / Remote Execution Exploits (RCE) - To do: define!



Remote Code Execution (RCE) Exploits - Helios  
Barracuda - a RCE for Chrome.
Dragonfly - a RCE for Chrome.
Orion - a webkit exploit for Android 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2.
Sparta - a RCE for Chrome.


Dugtrio access plugin



Resource (Hamr) Plugins 


Privilege Escalation

Chronos - exploits a vulnerability that affects Android devices running 4.0 and greater using a Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset. A privesc for Samsung GrandPrime and Mini4 devices. Written in C.

Flameskimmer - exploits devices which use a Broadcom WiFi chipset. A privesc for Broadcom wifi chipset devices such as Galaxy Note 4. Written in C.
Hyperion - covers devices using a Samsung Exynos (version 4212 and greater) chipset.
Freedroid - is an extremely generic vulnerability involving an oversight in data translation in the ARMProcessor manufacturer port of the Linux kernel, affecting most Android ARMProcessor manufacturer v7 devices running 4.0 - 4.3.



Post Exploits - non-persistence tool that collect data from targeted device.

Bowtie
Downloader
Suckerpunch



Implants - persitence-based data collection tool 
RoidRage




How to build AngerManagement
From your Angermanagement repo directory:

"make -j hamrtime all C=Debug "
To display verbose, use "V=1" flag ("make -j V=1 runtests")
To build in debug mode, use "C=Debug" ("make -j C=Debug V=1 runtests")

Plugins/ Components

Angry - Written in C. 
Bleak - An infoleak. Written in C.
Bowtie - A payload survey tool. Written in Java. Non-persitent.
Debug_log - 

Downloader - a Java program that is used to fetch a RoidRage download or an arbitrary payload. 
Dropper - Dropper is a library that adds drop and execute support to those privs that include/need it, such as Bowtie.
Dugtrio -  
Freedroid -  
Googletest - a simple wrapper to get Googletest libs built using NDK.
Hamdroid - To do!
Hamrtest - A set of testing resources for hamr plugins
Hamrtime - a tool to test interactions with all the various Hamr plugins. Its for development/testing purposes and **not** to be released.
Helios - a family of RCEs that provides the remote access via JavaScript. See above for a list of the RCEs that are part of Helios.
Hyperion -  
Legba - a 3rd party utility to wrap elf binaries with a bit shellcode to be run from a browser.

Makederps - To do!
Quafflehamr - replaced Mission Control. Hamr is a new framework for packaging and throwing browser exploits and payloads. It includes a set of tools to create HTTPHypertext Transfer Protocol serves used to throw RCEs and a 
Tahoma - RoidRage's installer
SELinux - To do!
Sepol_thirdparty - a subproject under the SELinux Project on github.com. It has been slightly modified for AM framework. SEPol is necessary for enumerating, reading, and injecting new rules into an SELinux policy on a device.
Stringobfuscation - To do!
Stubbydroid - provides supports utilities for shared objects found on devices such as Libcutils. 
Webutils - To do!



How to deploy AngerManagement

Configure a HTTPHypertext Transfer Protocol and NGINX server
Build AngerManagement (make -j delivery)
