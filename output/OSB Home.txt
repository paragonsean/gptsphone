Everyone should be worried.  I'm a frickin acting chief!  My authority is practically limitless.  And by limitless, I mean nonexistant...

Thanks for the clarification User #77534, I'm sure he was very worried.....

Thank you sir.  And for what its worth, I was threatening to fire User #1179751, not you.

I'll fix it up.  It's sort of obtuse, but you need to be a Space Admin to add the "Categories" to a Space. I'll make the whole OSBOperation Support Branch group Space Admins.
Space Categories look like the Labels, but they're for tagging outside of the space, while Labels tag inside the space.

Get this to show up under aed-branches or you're fired.
