VMware - Workaround for OVF Deployment Failed
Workaround for OVF Deployment Failed
Problem: When deploying VMs received from PW from OVF template and browsing to an OVA file, deployment fails with the following error message:
"OVF Deployment Failed: File ds:///vmfs/volumes/uuid/_deviceImage-0.iso was not found"
Cause: The CDCompact Disk drive was connected when OVA file was created, so now import process is attempting to mount a non-existent drive
Solution:

Use 7-zip to extract the contents of the OVA file (this is just a tar file)
Edit the .ovf file to change "vmware.cdrom.iso" to "vmware.cdrom.remotepassthrough"
Use Hashcalc to recalculate the SHA1 sum of the .ovf file and update this value in the .mf file
Re-tar the files to create a new OVA file
I used an Ubuntu linux VMVirtual Machine to do this becuase I couldn't make 7-zip work.
Note that the .ovf file must the first file in the new OVA file - the following process will work, but feel free to accomplish this how you see fit:
Copy the three files to be tar'd onto the //10.9.8.21/Share folder
Log in to an Ubuntu VMVirtual Machine with access 
Create a dir named share in /mnt if one does not already exist
Mount the share - mount -t cifs -o username=administrator,password=<password> //10.9.8.21/Share /mnt/share
Change directory into /mnt/share - you should see your files here
Create the tar first with the .ovf file, being sure to name it with a .ova extension - tar cvf vm.ova vm.ovf
Then add the .mf and .vmdk files - tar uvf vm.ova *.mf *.vmdk
The new OVA file can now be imported to VMware
