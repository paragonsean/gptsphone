Configure Windows Server 2003 VMVirtual Machine IP settings.  Setup FTPFile Transfer Protocol server.
8/21/2015

Installed Bumble on MSR.
CT 2.4 which was delieved is not compatible with current ICON image (Debian 7.8)

8/24/2015

Downloaded and installed Ubuntu Server 10.04. This is the library version that was delievered with Bumble.
Performed smoke test of Bumble.
Added survey commands:
tp survey create 192.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0 icmp -en
tp survey create 192.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0 tcp -en


Added redir rules:redir create 10.1.243.2 255.255.255.255 0 0 XXX.X.XXX.XXX (JUMPSTART-5[US]) 255.255.255.255 0 0 tcp 10.1.243.2 0 XXX.X.XXX.XXX (JUMPSTART-5[US]) 0 0 -en

Potential bug:
Add survey and redir rule.
redir create 10.1.243.2 255.255.255.255 0 0 XXX.X.XXX.XXX (JUMPSTART-5[US]) 255.255.255.255 0 0 tcp 10.1.243.2 0 XXX.X.XXX.XXX (JUMPSTART-5[US]) 0 0 -en
tp survey create XXX.X.XXX.X (JUMPSTART-5[US]) 255.255.255.0 0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0 tcp -en


Test redir.
Run Ixia test.
Test redir.  If redir fails, then re-try this sequence, but this time without adding the survey rules.  I wonder if the survey transaction log is filling causing the redir rule to stop working.  The translog stopped at index 4000 (is this coincidence or is this the size of the buffer?).



8/25/2015
Setup IXIA for testing through multiple interfaces.
8/26/2015

Tweaked IXIA to test through MSR with endpoints on neighboring devices.
Setup and began 72 hour test through all neighbors.  Score was active on DUT, but no redir/survey rules were created.

8/31/2015

Checked IXIA test.  The test "failed" according to the IXIA, however, the H3C did not reboot/crash.
Reconfigured interface - No observables.

9/1/2015
Wrote expect scripts to install patch.bin file and add a redir rule.
9/3/2015

Phone Call with User #75980:
score requires a minimum MTUMaximum Transmission Unit of 480Bytes for return traffic (from implant to CTCounter Terrorism).  
There is an undefined parameter in the ilm.txt file to configure the the Commx Rx size (CommsMaxIpRxSize)


Performed individual commands while running tcpdump to capture return packets from implant to route.  These captures depict each packet size for the UDPUser Datagram Protocol packets coming back in response to C2.

9/4/2015
Modified expect scripts to automate the following: reboot MSR, install implant, and run score survey test.
9/25/2015

Started 72-hour IXIA enterprise profile for MSR
Added latency to delay simulatorsudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 2.5s 0.5s loss 25% 25% duplicate 2% corrupt 3% reorder 25% 50%   (also added same command to eth1)

Started fresh Atk putty window and ran command: date && sudo time ./reboot_target.exp && sudo ./install_and_run.sh
Script ran all weekend and all tests were successful, except an ilm connect error was encountered when attempting to cleanup the redir rule after the last test.
The results can be found in the folder: \\10.9.8.21\Share\Testing\JQJARGON\Test_Results\2015-09-25

9/28/2015
Inspected wireshark data for test run over the weekend (see previous entry on this page) and noticed several TCPTransport Control Protocol retransmissions, DUPs, and a few Telnet RST. It seems that the RSTReal-time Transport Protocol packets are sent by the MSR to terminate the telnet session.

9/30/2015
Temporarily add routes to ASRAzure Site Recovery and TR-CoreSwx to allow VMVirtual Machine #3 (XX.XX.XXX.X (EARTHLINKBUSINESS-BLK[US])) access to DAB proxy so that nmap can be installed.
Add route to TR CoreSwx:ip route XX.XX.XXX.X (EARTHLINKBUSINESS-BLK[US]) 255.255.255.0 172.20.100.234 name Temp_For_Bumble_VM


Add route to Cisco ASR:ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 XXX.XXX.XX.X (EU-MAP-5[US])

Setup apt-get proxy settings on VMVirtual Machine #4.
Remove routes from routers when complete.


10/1/2015

Started Tests 1-4 with latency.  Ran in 6.5 hrs.  All tests passed.  Results: Bumble-wLatency_ICON5_2015-10-01_134059_window1.log

pcap file: test_output/151001_134345-tcpdump.pcap
This test resulted in BUM-8.

10/6/2015
Installed Xplico server and Analyzed pcap (from BUM-8).
Xplico decodes C2 and categorizes it as "Undecoded TCP-UDP" traffic.  

SNMP is also categorized as "Undecoded TCP-UDP" traffic.
The telnet sessions used during PBD installation is also clearly visible.  This shows all of the telnet commands that are issued (turning on/off Info-Center, ftp of patch file, etc).


10/9/2015

Started all tests at ~9:55AM (run_x_times.sh) to run 15 times over the weekend. Latency enabled.
Started IXIA ~10:15AM.

10/23/2015

Friday afternoon User #75978 started MSR performance baseline.  This is getting captured by solarwinds.  Take baseline measurements and snapshots on Monday before proceeding with Bumble 3.1 testing.
Bumble 3.1 testing will begin Monday.

10/27/2015

Installed Bumble 3.1
All expect scripts used to automate testing stopped working.  New version of CT/ilm seems to display output differently than previous CTCounter Terrorism version.

10/28/2015

Troubleshooted and modified expect scripts to resume automated testing.All expect scripts working.  Ran run_x_times.sh 3 times without failing.

Ran expect scripts w/o latency 60 times overnight (install once).Failed after looping 16 times.  Received "ilm is an unsupported command or group!" BUM-13



10/29/2015
Modified expect scripts to account for potential ilm connection error.  Will not attempt to reconnect.
10/30/2015

Sucessfully ran Bumble 3.1 eighty (80) times overnight.Results: /home/user1/testscripts/batch_results/20151030_1020-all_results

Started test to run over the weekend (15 times)Added latency.  Includes new "ct_pt5-savetrans_ftp.exp" test. Not running ixia.


11/3/2015
Ran tests overnight.  Took 4.5 hours to run tests 1-4/
All tests ran successfully
Tets Results:  /home/user1/testscripts/batch_results/20151104_1120-all_results


11/6/2015
Ran IXIA test.  Saved graphs for CPU/Memory usage and interface throughput.
11/9/2015
Investigated BUM-15.  Sent User #75981 log files.
11/10/2015

Re-installed PBD after exhausting all investigation into BUM-15.
Ran automated tests 10 times with latency.
./ct_pt2-redir_v2.exp failed 2 times
./confirm_transtable_file_exists.exp failed 3 times
./confirm_transtable_ftp_exists.exp failed 5 times



11/12/2015

Configured the IXIA to perform Stack Scrambling (fuzzing).
Turned off latency. Ran tests 80 times overnight.  Did not re-install since swiffer was stopped.
BATCH_DIR=/home/user1/testscripts/batch_results/20151113_1238-all_results
ICON_LOG=Bumble_ICON6_2015-11-12_142601_window1.log

11/13/2015

Re-installed implant (since swiffer had been removed).  Turned on latency, Ran tests 50 times over the weekend.  IXIA still running Stack Scrambler (fuzzing).
Tests ran successfully 15 times.  The only errors were with verifying the transtable was saved to the ftp server.  However, I am certain there is an issue with the script because when I run the command manually, the transtable is successfully saved to the ftp server.  Addtionally there was an error with redirection (2 out of 15).  Again, I believe this would be an issue with the scripts not being very resilient when encountering latency.

11/18/2015
Started IXIA Stack Scrambler and ran test with latency 3 times overnight.
