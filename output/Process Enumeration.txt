WMI Process Watcher
A technique to asynchronously detect when a process is created using WMI.
The technique requires an EventSink object that contains a reference to a callback.  Registering the aynchronous detection is done by calling ExecNotificationQueryAsync() with the proper WQL async query and a pointer to the EventSink object.
The queries need to detect creation and deletion of processes are as follows:

SELECT * FROM __InstanceCreationEvent WITHIN 1 WHERE TargetInstance ISA 'Win32_Process'
SELECT * FROM __InstanceDeletionEvent WITHIN 1 WHERE TargetInstance ISA 'Win32_Process'

 
The callbacks must have the following signature:
void __cdecl CallBack(long lObjectCount, IWbemClassObject **apObjArray)
