Setting up new DART tester VM (Fedora 20)
When setting up a local DARTTest-Software (commercial) environment for creating and submitting automated tests for the first time
Step-by-step guide

Add the steps involved:

Copy the VMVirtual Machine from \\fs-01\share\DART\Developer VM
Import and turn on the VM
Open a terminal and run "~/start_setup.bash".
See "Required user input during start_setup.bash"
At the end of the setup, two commands are generated and displayed in the terminal.
Enter these these commands to kick off your first automated DARTTest-Software (commercial) test.
See http://10.9.0.20/overview for the results.

How your VMVirtual Machine will look after "start_setup.bash"



Fedora 20
Yum works (repos set to repos.devlan.net in /etc/yum.repos.d/*)
Mercurial is installed
Git is installed
Vim is installed (with a python-compatible .vimrc)
Default user is "tester"
Default passwords for "tester" and "root"


Clones the "dartsetup" mercurial repo containing:
setup_local_dart.py
setup_local_dart_admin.py
setup_local_dart_repos.bash


Runs setup_local_dart.py which:
Creates a unique local hostname if one does not already exist (ex. IUXQPX.devlan.net)
Generates a RSAEncryption algorithm keypair for "tester" if one does not already exist
Copies your RSAEncryption algorithm public key to the DARTTest-Software (commercial) server (10.9.0.20) /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
Clones the DARTTest-Software (commercial) repos (tybase, tyworkflow, tyutils)
Calls "make" in tyworkflow
Creates a local tester "commits" directory on the DARTTest-Software (commercial) server (for your test files)
Provides the commands to run your first test (service_ping_plan)




"tester" password: this calls sudo as root permissions are required to change the local hostname
Accept DARTTest-Software (commercial) server RSAEncryption algorithm key: type "yes" to initiate the trust relationship between your VMVirtual Machine and the DARTTest-Software (commercial) server
DART server root password: this is the one and only time you will ever have to enter the root password. This is required to copy your local public key to the server's authorized_keys. "ssh root@10.9.0.20" will work without a password when this is done. Remote_commit will run much more smoothly after this.
Create a unique tester identifier: this will identify your tests in Overview to other users. Choose something without spaces such as your initials, first initial and last name, etc. (ex. "saf" or "sfoerster")
The two commands needed to run your first test are provided. Enter them and watch DARTTest-Software (commercial) submit your test files, generate combos, and launch your tests.
