AED Development Workflow



How the Magic Happens
An often overlooked topic of tradecraft is how AEDApplied Engineering Devision actually goes about the software development process – beginning to end.  
This is a high level overview of what AEDApplied Engineering Devision is working towards, for a more in-depth description please see the attached documents which fully describe the who, what, when, where, why and how. 
In this space are the PEER (i.e. not Management) recommended ways of customizing the development of a new project.  
Many options have been tried, many options have failed. 
Some of these are must do's, and some are strongly worded suggestions (that may or may not earn you scornful looks if you stray from them).
They are here to give you or your Branch a starting point and the freedom to develop your own "Best Practices".
