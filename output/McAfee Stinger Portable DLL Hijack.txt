McAfee Stinger Portable DLL Hijack
Procmon screenshot of protential DLLDynamic Link Library options:

McAfee attempts to load "mfeaaca.dll" several times, including when it runs a scan, and thus may not be the best candidate.
the stinger32ENU.dll and stinger32LOC.dll locations resulted in McAffe crashing when returning FALSE from PROCSESS_ATTACH.  "vm3dum.dll" was never loaded
 
"DWrite.dll" worked fine when calls were forwarded to the proper system DLL
"DXGIDebug.dll" did not cause problems when returning FALSE from PROCESS_ATTACH (and thus no calls were forwarded)
