SECRET//NOFORN
 
OSB Library: Payload Deployment

Module Name: ShellExecute_CRS - Chorus
 
Module Description: This module uses the Shell Execute Windows APIApplication Programming Interface call to create a process. No handle to the created process is returned with this module. The payload, if supplied is written to a user configurable location with user configurable attributes. Cmd.exe /C is added as a prefix to the ShellExecute command.
 
PSP/OS Issues: PSPs should be tested on a per tool basis.
 
('excerpt' missing)
 
Sharing Level: Liaison (well known technique)
 
Technique Origin: Internet/open-source (well-defined Windows APIApplication Programming Interface)
 
Notes: 

No handle to the created process is returned
cmd.exe /c is prepended to the command string supplied by the target path and arguments
Quotes are placed around the Target Path in the command line

 
Module Specific Structures:

struct PARAM_CRS
{
	WCHAR *wcArgs;		//The arguments to the executable being executed
	DWORD dwAttribs;	//The attributes of the target payload on disk
	WCHAR *wcTarget;	//The target path of the executable to drop to disk
};


 
 
Example Code:
 
HANDLE hHandle = NULL;


IPayload *myPayload = new ShellExecute_CRS();


PARAM_CRS params;
params.dwAttribs = FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN | FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM;
params.wcTarget = L"C:\\Test Folder\\MyTest.exe";
params.wcArgs = L"1 2 3";


IPayload::PayloadErr pErr = myPayload->execute(improvedDummy, sizeof(improvedDummy), ¶ms, sizeof(params), &hHandle);
