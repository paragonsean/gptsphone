Build Python 3.4 on RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
I prefer to install python to /opt/python34 instead of /usr/local. Just make sure to update your path to include /opt/python34/bin and add /opt/python34/lib to your LD path, or edit the prefix argument in the configure statement below.
 
sudo yum install -y readline-devel sqlite-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel bzip2-devel expat-devel gdbm-devel xz-devel tk-devel valgrind-devel 
tar zxvf Python-3.4.3.tgz
cd Python-3.4.3
./configure --enable-shared --enable-loadable-sqlite-extensions --enable-ipv6 \
            --with-system-ffi --with-system-expat --with-signal-module --with-threads --with-valgrind \
	        --with-fpectl --with-ensurepip --prefix=/opt/python34
make && make install
As Root:
echo "/opt/python34/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/python34.conf
ldconfig
