NGINX / Apache Server Issues and Gotchas
 

nginx and apache seem to respond differently for HTTPHypertext Transfer Protocol POST and GET requests. nginx causes old Nightskies code to crash when parsing the network stream, while it works fine in Apache. Still need to investigate why this is the case. 
Check the SSLSecure Socket Layer version supported by the server VS what the implant is using - for example, Nightskies 2.9.1 was using SSLVersion3 while the test nginx server only supported TLSTransport Layer Security v1.
If MISSIONCONTROL server is missing parameters in the HTTPHypertext Transfer Protocol response / POST from the target device, ensure NGINX redirection isn't stripping the parameters(http://test.com/val=1&anothervalue=2)


 
Launchctl Issues - "Could not find domain for" on OSXApple operating system 10.10 Yosemite

Make sure the launchd.plist is in ~/Library/LaunchAgents
chown it to the same user and group that is executing the launchd plist
The user loading the plist must be logged in via the GUIGraphical User Interface - if its just over SSH, it still will not work. After logging in, you can ssh in and launchctl load it successfully.
