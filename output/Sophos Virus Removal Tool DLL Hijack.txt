Sophos Virus Removal Tool DLL Hijack
Similar to others... msimg32.dll
 
FoxIt attempts to load the system DLLDynamic Link Library "msimg32.dll" adjacent to itself first before loading it in the proper location.  The DLLDynamic Link Library export 5 functions with the following prototypes:
typedef VOID(WINAPIWindows Application Programming Interface *vSetDdrawflag)(VOID);typedef BOOL(WINAPIWindows Application Programming Interface *AlphaBlend)(HDC, int, int, int, int, HDC, int, int, int, int, BLENDFUNCTION);typedef DWORD(WINAPIWindows Application Programming Interface *DllInitialize)(DWORD, DWORD);typedef BOOL(WINAPIWindows Application Programming Interface *GradientFill)(HDC, PTRIVERTEX, ULONG, PVOID, ULONG, ULONG);typedef BOOL(WINAPIWindows Application Programming Interface *TransparentBlt)(HDC, int, int, int, int, HDC, int, int, int, int, UINT);
 
To hijack this DLL, take the following steps:

Determine if you're running on a 32 or 64 bit machine and call GetSystemDirectory() or GetSystemWow64Directory()
LoadLibrary on the real msimg32.dll
Call GetProcAdress on each of the functions listed above and store in global pointers
Re-route all calls to any of these functions to the "real" functions and return appropriately
