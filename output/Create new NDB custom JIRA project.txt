Cloning a VM Checklist - Linux
These steps should be performed whenever a linux VMVirtual Machine is cloned via a VMVirtual Machine Template or directly from another VM.
 
If the VMVirtual Machine you are cloning has a script named "clone_vm_checklist.sh" in the user's home directory, you can run the script and it will perform steps A & B for you.  Step C is usually not necessary as it is already installed on all the Base VMs.
A. Change IP Address
Edit /etc/network/interfacesSample DHCPDynamic Host Configuration Protocol IP Config:

# The loopback network interfaceauto loiface lo inet loopback
# The primary network nterfaceauto eth0iface eth0 inet dhcp
Sample Static IP Config:
# The loopback network interfaceauto loiface lo inet loopback
# The primary network interfaceauto eth0iface eth0 inet static address 10.9.8.99 netmask 255.255.255.0 network 10.9.8.0 broadcast 10.9.8.255 gateway 10.9.8.1 # dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed dns-nameservers 10.9.8.21 dns-search testrange.local
B. Edit the hostname

/etc/hostname
/etc/hosts
If using a static IP address, add the line "<static IP>   <hostname>.<domain name>  <hostname>"
If using an IP address from DHCP, add the line "127.0.1.1   <hostname>.<domain name>  <hostname>"



C. Install VMware tools (if applicable)
Install open-vm-tools
On a server use the command "sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools"
On a desktop use the command "sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools && sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools-desktop"


D. Assign Tag(s) to the VMVirtual Machine in vSphere
