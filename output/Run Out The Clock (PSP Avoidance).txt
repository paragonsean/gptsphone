                        Run Out The Clock (PSP Avoidance)
Overview
PSP sandboxes typically have a set time limit they analyze a program for before making a decision.  PSPs do not want impose unnecessarily long wait times on the user, which may cause the user to disable PSPPersonal Security Product (Anti-Virus) components or try other products out of frustration.  A common technique of exploiting this mechanism is using a Sleep-like call at the start of a program to 'run out the clock'.  PSPs caught on and many will skip the sleep calls in their sandbox environment.   To counteract this, Malware authors will call a meaningless function which performs some kind of task or calculation that takes a while to complete, before performing any malicious action.  This makes it harder/impossible for PSPs to know what to skip, and the Malware can effectively 'run out the clock' while in a PSPPersonal Security Product (Anti-Virus) sandbox.
