                        Concepts: High Level
 
Goals of Creating and Maintaining EDGEngineering Development Branch Code Libraries

Provide sets of reliable code for use in EDGEngineering Development Branch toolsets (most important in tools that require timely development). Improving quality of code is important in evading detection.
Document techniques and modules for sharing amongst developers. 
Track technique usage
Operations
Areas of Responsibilities
Tools


Track technique limitations (operationally and technically).
Releasability
Technique Orgins
PSP and OSOperating System issues


Provide developers with an understanding of current techniques
Track depth of techniques
Create a platform for measured signature diversity
A common interface for modular development
Multiple/Diverse sets of the similar techniques for signature diversity.
Direct developer time to researching new techniques and more complex tools. 


 
Current Library List
Core Library - Maintains all interfaces and debugging modules
Execution Vectors
Privilege Escalation
Data Transfer (Exfil/Infil/Covert Storage)
Buffers
Payload Deployment
Survey
File Collection
System Monitoring and Manipulation
Persistence
Miscellaneous (EDGEngineering Development Branch APIApplication Programming Interface)
 
 
EDG Library Model



When creating a new tool:

Find the modules you wish to implement.
Track usage of any modules on the appropriate documentation pages
Note any bugs/issues to the user, jira, and/or the module documentation pages.
If there are too few modules of the type you want, create your own.
If you wish to change the signature of a module do so and add the module to the appropriate library.
