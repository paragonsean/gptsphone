                        Queue Tar File Format
Notes

The tar file is comprised of a command file and optional data files.   
The first file added to the tar must be the command file.
The command file is JSONJavascript Object Model encoded.  
The outer layer is a dictionary of command meta-data,   timestamp, user, command code, etc.
The embedded layer, under the key "data" is it's own JSONJavascript Object Model dictionary format.  There are two now,  change_list (from C2), and queue_state (from LPListening Post)


command sequence (cmdseq) is from C2,  response sequence (respseq) is from LP,  both are one-up
sequence numbers are exchanged between C2 and LP
an echoed cmdseq from LPListening Post lets C2 know the last command seen
an echoed respseq from C2 lets LPListening Post know any updates (i.e. task uploaded to implant) it made were seen by C2



Format
cmd_file [task_files] //cmd_file must be first in tar file, no nested folders
task_files = [task_file] [task_files]
task-file = binary file representing tasks // required for append, prepend, insert
cmd_file = <json_cmds>
json_cmds = command <cmd> queue <que_id> timestamp < time> user <userid> data <data>
// the literals (e.g, command) above are json tags or keys in the python dictionaries
cmd = 1 // create queue
2 // delete queue
3 // update queue
que_id - alphanumeric, at least 5 alphanumeric (fisrt 4 are parent id)
time = numberic time // int(mktime(gmtime())) when command sent
userid = os userid, numeric
data = [change_list | queue_state]
change_list = < json_changes>
json_changes = cmdseq <seq> respseq <seq> updates <changes>
// the literals (e.g, updates) above are json tags or keys in the python dictionaries
seq = numeric // one-up numbers for que updates cmd from qproxy, resp from queue
changes = change [changes]// a python list of change strings
change = <verb> [to] [from] [filename]
verb =
0 // NOP
1 // insert
2 //append
3 //prepend
4 // move
5 // delete
to = <slot | id>
from = <slot | id>
id - alphanumeric, fails on conversion to number
slot - digits only / numeric
