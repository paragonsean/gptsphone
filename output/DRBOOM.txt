End to End Nightskies 3.x Install with Poseidon

Log into http://poseidon.devlan.net/ and select 'Web Application'
Create a new device, and configure it. mdbtest.devlan.net is already set up as a LPListening Post for Nightskies 3.x. The LPListening Post directory is /srv/www/nsx.
Generate the Install package.
Use MISSIONCONTROL / CRUNCHYLIMESKIES to install Nightskies.
Create new JOB in POSEIDON.
scp over the new .avc file over to the LP. Use the '~/addjob.sh' script to add the job to the database.
Browse to a webpage on the implanted device to create some traffic and trigger a beacon.
scp the output files from /srv/www/nsx/outbox/ over to the poseidon SMB share, smb://poseidon.devlan.net/Import/
Refresh the poseidon web application and you should see new data products for your device.

These are instructions are specific for DEVLAN installs, but besides the urls, everything else should be the same. The official Nightskies and Poseidon documentation go more into detail.
