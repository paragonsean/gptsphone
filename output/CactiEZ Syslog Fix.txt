Install Ubuntu on Mac Hardware
Good step by step guide on how to do this can be found on the interwebs at http://heeris.id.au/2014/ubuntu-plus-mac-pure-efi-boot/
A number of packages are needed, all are on the distribution repos except for mactel-boot.  This can be found on the share at //fs-01.devlan.net/share/Linux/utilities/mactel-boot_0.9-1-trusty_amd64.User #75201
Tips

This is necessary to make the superdrive worth with ubuntu.  It does not persist if the superdrive is unplugged.

plug in the superdrive
install sg3-utils
Find which device is assigned to the superdrive (e.g. /dev/sr0)
run "sg_raw /dev/sr0 EA 00 00 00 00 00 01"
