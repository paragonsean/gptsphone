Service Persistence (PSEDService_CF - Constant Flow)
SECRET//NOFORN
 
OSB Library: Persistence

Module Name: PSEDService_CF (Constant Flow)
 
Module Description: This module installs the calling payload as a service and handles all appropriate Service Control Manager (SCM) interactions.  The calling payload does not have to do anything additional to exist as a service.  The calling payload simply calls PersistPayload and continues code execution flow as normal.  The module can also persist a DLLDynamic Link Library payload if being called by RunDLL32
 
PSP/OS Issues: No known issues
 
('excerpt' missing)

Sharing Level: Unilateral
 
Technique Origin: In-house
 
Notes:

Can only persist payload calling module, not an external payload
Relies on payload creating a Event to wait on so SCM can gracefully exit service upon payload completion
If calling payload exists before Event is set, could result in SCM reporting improper stopping of service
Must install persistence with a service name
