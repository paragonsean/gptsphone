Enable Copy/Paste for VMs
This describes how to enable copy and paste functionality between the guest operating system and remote consoles.  This feature is disabled by default on esxi 4.1 and later.
Step-by-step guide
These steps were tested on ESXi 6.0

Backup /etc/vmware/settings.cp /etc/vmware/settings /etc/vmware/<DATE>.settings

vi /etc/vmware/settings
Add these lines:
isolation.tools.copy.disable = "false"
isolation.tools.paste.disable = "false"


Type :wq! to close the file
Restart your VM.

 
This setting will not survive a host upgrade. So if you upgrade your host, you will need to re-apply these changes.
