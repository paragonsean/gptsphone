Retrospective



What did we do well?

full staffing was good
coordination/work performed, no confusion w/r/t who was doing what
"Agile structure" discipline



What should we have done better?

Biting off more than can chew in sprint continues to be a challenge.
Lack of knowing how some individual stories contribute to the overall goal?




What will we do differently next time to improve?
More focus on capactity planning light.
Better comms along with the assimilation of new staffing.
