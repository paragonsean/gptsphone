Development VMs
This page is for recording any information related to the development/build VMs that are in use by the project.  Ideally, this information should be able to allow one to replicate a particular VM, in order to avoid the "Works on my box!" phenomena.  Note that the dev boxes should not be overly customized such that one runs into a "Works on my VM!" phenomena, as that really defeats the entire purpose, which is to allow someone to quickly get rolling and/or provide a "known good" environment for debugging & troubleshooting.

Look into using Vagrant for automating the process of configuring your development virtual machines.  Then you can store this configuration alongside of your source code in version control.
"Infrastructure as code".
