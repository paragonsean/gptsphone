Git repositories will hold all of the libraries. Each library will have a primary maintainer. Stash will be the interface used for any code review.
 
Branch Descriptions:
Master Branch: Official releases to be used by everyone else (requires pull request for merge, minimum library maintainer and 1 architect approver).
Develop Branch: Stable branch that could be used if cutting edge functions are required for a project. Requires pull request for merge with 2 code reviewers.
Feature Branch: Any state. Wild west.
Bug Fix Branch: Comes off master and is integrated into Master and Develop
 
Each Library exists as a Git Submodule. Some submodules may require others. Documentation should point out all of the dependencies of a library (responsibility of library maintainer).
