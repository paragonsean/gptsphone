Shell Scripting Tricks

('toc' missing)
String contains string
stringContains() { [ -z "${2##*$1*}" ] && [ -z "$1" -o -n "$2" ]; }

# Used like so
SRC_STRING="this is a sample string where TEST we want to check for the word 'TEST'"
if stringContains "TEST" "$SRC_STRING"; then
	echo "Found TEST in SRC_STRING"
else
	echo "Couldn't find TEST in SRC_STRING"
fi
This method is nice because it will work across a variety of bash-like shells making it incredibly platform independent. It will also work if the source string is empty.
