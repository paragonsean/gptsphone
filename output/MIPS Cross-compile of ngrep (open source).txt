A Collection of somewhat, but not quite, useless information

I'm not 100% sure why you are here, but if you want to see what I'm working on currently that information will be found here.  Do pay attention to my blog as I do try and post useful information there; mostly about Visual Studio or Windows development in general, but I will be expanding to include conversations about DART, Bamboo, JIRA, whatever.

Congrats on finally locking down your user page.  But now what am I going to do when I am here until AfterMidnight   (lolz) and I feel compelled to deface a page?

Still haven't cleaned up and locked down your user page I see... too bad I am too tired to find anything creative or original to further deface it with.  So I'll just do something trite and hackneyed instead...

So... I fixed all my tests and was rerunning them in DART, and somebody had a bamboo build for bartender that took over an hour to complete and was hogging the XPWindows operating system (Version) 64 VMVirtual Machine I needed.  Now I'm here past 9 trying to make sure all my frickin tests passed.
You are so dead...

I’ve half-jokingly said that I’m going to either pull the division into the 21st century or go down kicking and screaming.
We will go down in flames together!

User #1179751, you get a "Like" on your page for somehow magically knowing that the Resource APIApplication Programming Interface calls on windows are (weirdly) asynchronous, which totally explained the weird-ass timing issues we have been seeing for months across all of the resource-based config GUIs.
Plas-wan!
