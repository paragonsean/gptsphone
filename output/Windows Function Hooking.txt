Hook Functions via Export Address Table (MISCHookFunctions_EAT_NTRN)
SECRET//NOFORN
 
Miscellaneous Module
Stash Repository: Miscellaneous Library

Module Name: MISCHookFunctions_EAT_NTRN (Uses Windows APIApplication Programming Interface and winternl.h data structures)
 
Module Description: Hooks functions in the target DLLDynamic Link Library by modifying entries in the EAT.  Works for libraries that are delay loaded;  the best way to ensure this works properly is to start the target process suspended, create a thread that loads the target DLLDynamic Link Library and performs the hook, then resume the process.  Subsequent calls to LoadLibrary on the target DLLDynamic Link Library will return the reference to the already loaded library that has had its EAT entry for the target process  patched.
 
Usage: Forthcoming
 
PSP/OS Issues: Any PSP/OS issues associated with the technique.
