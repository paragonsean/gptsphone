Not Used Retrospectives
This page is for holding notes gleaned via sprint retrospectives.
I could delete this page since JIRAUser Managment Software (Atlassian) does the automagickZ, but there are some useful comments at the bottom of the page/

Other than a desire to put the individual retrospective pages in a lump of their own, it worked out well.

As far as I can tell, only Spaces.  I think that standard practice for use of Confluence in the Real World is a space per project.  That might prove unwieldy here though.

Groovy!
Is there a way of getting this instance of JIRAUser Managment Software (Atlassian) to shove retrospectives into children of a specified sub-page?
I will have to do some Duck-Duck-Bing-Oogling.

When the dialog comes up after you close a Sprint in JIRA, it asks you to specify in which Confluence Space you want to put the Retrospective.  (see the one I just made in Playground)
There is no need to link JIRA Projects to Confluence spaces for Retrospectives.

I did not know that.  That's a neat feature.
AFAIK, the JIRAUser Managment Software (Atlassian) instance of the project and this wiki space are not linked, though.

No need to create this page, when you create a retro when you close out a sprint from JIRA, it makes a holding page automagically.
