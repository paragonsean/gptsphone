                        Creating a Winshell Test Environment
So you've created a new tool but you need to test it using winshell (NOD's FIO shell tool)... Have no fear, the latest Winshell updates have made the configuration process easier.
Step-by-step guide
Setup the "Execution Platform Environment"

Install a base Ubuntu VMVirtual Machine with a Desktop GUI.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install libc6:i386
sudo apt-get install libssl0.9.8:i386
sudo apt-get install libssl1.0.0:i386
sudo apt-get install libstdc++6:i386
(optional) sudo apt-get install vim
Change directory to /opt
Unzip WP_C_Python-2.7.3-binaries.tgz inside of /opt
Unzip the Winshell-unconfigured/bin folder to /opt/winshell


The Winshell-unconfigured/bin folder can be acquired from User #77732 in NOD. Refer to Appendix C of the Winshell 2.3 User's Guide for more information.
Configure a winshell for testing

cd /opt/winshell
vi testtools/beacon.confEdit the Servers variable with the correct hostname and IP address of your beacon server.

make credsUse a passphrase that is easy to remember for testing.

sh export_creds.shcreds.tgz contains several files that you will need later.

make configSeveral EXEs and a config folder will be created in the testtools directory.
