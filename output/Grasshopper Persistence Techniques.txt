User #77478 is the POCPoint of Contact, Proof of Concept for Icon Overlay.  Short answer we register as a provider of icon overlays (ie, the green check in something like TortoiseSVN) and thus get execution in explorer.exe as the user.

I'm curious to know how the Icon Overlay technique works.  Any description available somewhere?
Also, what does "Number of Stubs" mean?
