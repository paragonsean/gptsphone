One possible source of your space bing consumes is Crash logs.  You can use your favorite method to remove remove the logs.

One more strange location of collecting files is:
/private/var/mobile/Library/Caches/com.apple.springboard.sharedimagecache/Persistent

SpringBoard related .cpbitmap files may start to collect here

Not if there are a ton of file in the directory, try the following command to remove them
echo SBUIControlCenterButton._backgroundImageWithGlyphImage.bg_<optional add file numbers here>* | xargs rm
