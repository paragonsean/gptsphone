Stash Repository: Miscellaneous Library

Module Name: MISCFileVersion_WIN32 (Using Win32 APIApplication Programming Interface)
 
Module Description: This module allows you to grab the major and minor version numbers of a file. Calling this function on a windows file (ex: kernel32.dll) will also get the accurate Operating System version numbers (gets around OSVERSIONINFO on Win 8/8.1). The module uses GetFileVersionInfo and VerQueryValue to determine the major and minor version of the file.
 
Usage:

/*
	Gets the file version major and minor number using the GetFileVersionInfo Windows
	API call. 
*/
static BOOL GetFileMajorMinor(WCHAR *wcFilePath, DWORD &dwMajor, DWORD &dwMinor);

 wcFilePath: The path to the file the version information should be extracted from.
dwMajor: Is returned with the major version number of the file.
dwMinor: is returned with the minor version number of the file.
Returns TRUE on success and FALSE on failure.
 
PSP/OS Issues: No known issues.

 //Get OSOperating System major/minor by calling GetFileMajorMinor on kernel32
DWORD dwMajor = 0;
