MikroTik Hotspot / Paywall Analysis
Platform: RB493G (mipsbe) ROS 6.28
MT IPs: 192.168.88.1, 192.168.0.1, 10.0.0.1
The IP 192.168.0.11 is a non-existent host.

Configured MT Hotspot (paywall) feature.  This creates several firewall rules on the MT and applies them to the interface the hotspot was enabled on.
Enabling the hotspot features disables WebFig on that interface.  Winbox is still accessible on that interface.
If authenticated, WebFig can be accessbile at another IP of the MT (ie another LANLocal Area Network or the WANWide Area Network)
Can obtain WANWide Area Network IP from /proc/net/arp.  Can Chikorita be ported to grab this file (unauthenticated)?
The following results were obtained when run unauthenticated to the paywall.
"nmap -sS" shows IPs as up but really is just MT IP (false positive).
"ping" says 'Destination Net Prohibited'.
"nmap -PU" performs a UDPUser Datagram Protocol scan and receives results (appears to bypass MT FW). ie. "nmap -PU <IP> -p 80"


When doing an nmap TCPTransport Control Protocol scan, the MT spoofs each IP that is scanned.  Results returned are those that pertain to the MT itself.

The following were run from the host 192.168.88.3 without being authenticated.  The router and VMVirtual Machine were rebooted.

sudo nmap -PU 192.168.0.1 -p 80

sudo nmap -PU 192.168.0.11 -p 80

sudo nmap -sS 192.168.0.1 -p 80

sudo nmap -sS 192.168.0.1 -p 80
