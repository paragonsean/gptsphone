Bypassing the use of any DHCPDynamic Host Configuration Protocol server SPARC Clients

Not Verified
For provisioning SPARC clients you can work around having to make any changes to the pre-existing DHCPDynamic Host Configuration Protocol server by giving the SPARC client,  through the its PROM, the client's network identity and the address of the AIArtificial Intelligence server. This information will enable the SPARC client to send a request to that server to boot and begin the install process. To set up this information in the boot PROM follow the instructions below. Note that the client to be provisioned does not have to be on the same subnet as the AI server.
{b} ok setenv network-boot-arguments 
host-ip=<client-ip>,router-ip=<router-ip>,\
subnet-mask=<mask>,hostname=<name-of-client>,\
file=http://<aiserver-ip>:5555/cgi-bin/wanboot-cgi
{b} ok boot net - install
where:


client-ip is the IP address of system to have Solaris installed

router-ip is the IP address of the router. If AIArtificial Intelligence server and client are on same private subnet, use the AIArtificial Intelligence server's IP. Typically the router is xxx.xxx.xxx.1 or xxx.xxx.xxx.254.

subnet-mask is the network mask, e.g. 255.255.255.0.

name-of-client is the hostname assigned to the client on which Solaris will be installed.

aiserver-ip is the IP address of the AIArtificial Intelligence Server
