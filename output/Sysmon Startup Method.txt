The debuggerd startup method for RoidRage on ICS/Jellybean phones follows the following process:


Debuggerd service starts, started by the 'init' process per the 'init.rc' script


Inside of the do_server function, we have added a call to our own function, start_rr

Initialize the hook for the ril by changing the rild.libpath property so that our library will be loaded in place of the original ril library.  Our ril library (referred to as the 'ril shim') then loads the original and man-in-the-middle's function calls that go to and from the actual library.
Load the flag file that is used to determine state in the case of a crash (IEInternet Explorer determine if RRRoidRage (Malware) is already running and if so, what is its PIDProcess ID)
Create the startup thread, which:calls do_fork(), which
simply forks from debuggerd (since SELinux is not enabled and thereby restricting the debuggerd process)
drop the precore stub to the ramdisk from an array in memory which is encrypted, decrypting it in the process
executes the precore stub (followed by the RoidRage precore, followed by RoidRage itself)



Create the property thread which:
waits for rild to start up
checks to see if rild has been successfully hooked
kills rild if it is not hooked
once it has been hooked, it restores the rild.libpath to the value that it should be so that it does not appear to have been changed
