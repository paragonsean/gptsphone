Testing Different Network Connectivity States Using Network Link Conditioner

If you have a previous Network Link Conditioner preference panel installed, remove it, clear the trash, and restart your machine.
Install the latest Network Link Conditioner from the Hardware IOInformation Operations Tools dmg -  use fs-01.devlan.net/share/MDB/OSX/Software/Apple/hardwareiotools_for_xcode_6.1.dmg for Mavericks
Restart your machine
Network Link Conditioner should now be properly installed and you can enable the different profiles.
