Building Cross Compilers with Crosstool-NG
Note: Use the following instructions for an UNCLASSIFIED Internet-connected host. Ct-ng has to be able to download the various software components based upon the configuration specified.

Install the latest version of Crosstool-NG (ct-ng).
Create a directory for the building the toolchains: mkdir toolchains

Create a subdirectory for a given architecture: mkdir toolchains/arm

In that directory run ct-ng menuconfig and then configure the toolchain.
Within the first menu option "Paths and misc options" set the Prefix directory to a directory where the resulting toolchain is to reside. For example: /opt/x-tools/${CT_TARGET}

 Also, enable Debug crosstool-NG and select: Save intermedate steps, gzip saved states, and Interactive shell on failed comands

 .


Once configured, build the toolchain using ct-ng build.
The resulting toolchain will reside in the Prefix directory as specified in the configuration.
