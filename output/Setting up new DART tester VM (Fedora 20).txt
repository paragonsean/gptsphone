                        DART may be sporadically up and down this afternoon after 2p
I'm adding more thumbdrives to DARTTest-Software (commercial) so it may be down and your tests may or may not get zapped while I'm doing this.  In addition one of the thumbdrives will be out of commission for a while.  So test at your own risk! If this is going to be a really big issue let me know, but if not, I'll do my best to get in get out and have DARTTest-Software (commercial) all the way up.
Thanks for your cooperation!
