Thanks for the heads up.  I added a link to Captain Jack on the IEInternet Explorer Credential Storage page.  It is good that we have a wiki where the pages can act as a focal point for various knowledge and projects.

As a heads up, since I saw you had sections for credentials, User #7995631 developed a tool called Captain Jack (stash link) that collects creds from all 3 browsers.  A lot of the gory details for how the different browsers and their various versions store things is there in the code.
