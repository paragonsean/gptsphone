Retrospective



What did we do well?
I totally made some projects.Â  Yeah!


What should we have done better?

My first commit I forgot to include the JIRAUser Managment Software (Atlassian) issues
When I did include the JIRAUser Managment Software (Atlassian) issues, I commited them to master instead of develop
Need to remember to setup repository permissions and visibility for JIRAUser Managment Software (Atlassian) filters so that everything is visible to the whole project team.




What will we do differently next time to improve?
Don't noob it up so hard next time.
