# ip netstream export host 10.9.8.22 2055 (actual config uses port 9021)

NetStream is an accounting technology that provides statistics on a per-flow basis. An IPv4 flow is defined by the following 7-tuple elements: Destination IP address, Source IP address, Destination port number, Source port number, Protocol number, ToS, Inbound or outbound interface.
Configure the address and port number of the NetStream server as the destination for the NetStream data export. Use the default source interface for the NetStream data export.
