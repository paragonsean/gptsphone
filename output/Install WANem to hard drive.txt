CactiEZ Syslog Fix
If you install CactiEZ, and configure remote logging on a device, you may notice that is doesn't show up in Cacti.  This is due to a bug in the rsyslog config on the Cacti server.  To fix the configuration, follow the step below:

Log into Cacti server CLICommand-Line Interface using the username 'root' and the password you set for the 'admin' user.
Edit the following in /etc/rsyslog.conf (You may want to create a backup of the config file first)
Uncomment the lines:
$ModLoad imudp
$ModLoad imtcp


Change %syslogfacility%, %syslogpriority%, to '%syslogfacility-text%', '%syslogpriority-text%', 

Notice the variables are now in quotes


Restart syslog serviceservice rsyslog restart

If you have a device configured to send syslog messages to Cacti, you should now see them appear in the Syslog tab.
