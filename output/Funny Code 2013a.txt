Tradecraft

Tradecraft...or to put it another way, “Kid, I’ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other, and I’ve seen a lot of strage stuff, but I’ve never seen anything to make be believe that there’s one all-powerful Force controlling everything... It’s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.”
Where are the Simple Tricks and Nonsense...Funny Code...Hacks pages? The various rationals I used to organize them just got all out of whack. I had trouble finding them without the search feature. It wasn’t organized so I just rearranged the entries roughly to the year in which they were originally posted.
