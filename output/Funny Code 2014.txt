Funny Code post from 2011.

These are some notes regarding working with net-snmp on Windows. This assumes you have downloaded and compile the net-snmp set of command line tools and are standing them up on a development box.

  Setup your MIBDIRS environment variable to point to your MIBS directory.
  Test it by translating a MIB using snmptranslate. For example: "snmptranslate 1.3.6.1.2.1.5". Observing messages like 'Cannot find module (IP-MIB): At line 0 in (none)' in the output indicates that this is not setup correctly. You will also note the intuitive translation name 'iso.3.6.1.2.1.5'.  When it is setup correctly then you will get a friendly name such as "IP-MIB::icmp".
  Download additional MIBs from your manufacturer as needed and extract them to this directory.

Given a particluar OID a text description can be obtain using the command: "snmptranslate -On -Td .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5". User friendly names can be obtained using: "snmptranslate .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5". The OID can be obtained from the friendly name using: "snmptranslate -On SNMPv2-MIB::sysName". It is possible to search the MIB using: "snmptranslate -TB foo".
Once this is setup then snmpwalk can be used to interrogate a device. For example: "snmpwalk -c public -v 2c 10.3.1.34 > xero_snmpwalk_test.txt" prints a very lengthy file about one of the printers on devlan.

Dumps the calling module and the dll its attempting to load.
bp kernel32!LoadLibraryA "ln @$ra; du ecx; g"bp kernel32!LoadLibraryW "ln @$ra; du ecx; g"

Insert the disk but do not mount it. If it automounts then unmount it.
# for a cdromdd if=/dev/cdrom of=cd.iso# for a dvddd if=/dev/dvd of=dvd.iso

First identify the patch in question and download it.

Second extract the contents. For Security Updates you can execute the install exe, observe the unpack folder, copy the contents to another directory, and then cancel the install.



 Ever see the following linker error?
Linking...LIBCMTD.lib(wincrt0.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _WinMain@16 referenced in function ___tmainCRTStartupC:\Work\rdb\epione\Debug\ConfigureEpione.exe : fatal error LNK1120: 1 unresolved externals

There are number of setting that can influence this error. For example your PREPROCESSOR flags or perhaps the main() declaration. The most nonintuitive setting is the subtle Linker | System | SubSystem setting. 


#ifdef USE_BREAK_ON_START // In WinXP at service start, on breakpoint hit cancel and select debugger // In Vista at service start, Services are launched in the session 0 desktop // while the interactive debugger is in the session 1 desktop. When the  // debugger is not attached the breakpoint is handled as an application  // exception e.g. exit process. // Remote debugging at application start up, use the debug break to pause // until the debugger is connected. for (int bContinue = 1; bContinue && !IsDebuggerPresent(); )  Sleep(1000); DebugBreak();#endif // USE_BREAK_ON_START

  * Start by mounting the iso image some where.    - su (or use sudo)    - mkdir /iso/repo    - mkdir -p /iso/repo/dvd    - chcon -t mnt_t /iso/repo/dvd    - mount -r -o loop /path/to/FC-5-i386-DVD.iso /iso/repo/dvd    - cd /iso/repo    - rpm -Uvh dvd/Fedora/RPMS/createrepo*    - createrepo .  * Add DVDDigital Versatile Disk ISOInternational Standard Organization to fstab to mount it at every boot    - /path/to/FC-5-i386-DVD.iso /iso/repo/dvd iso9660 ro,loop 0 0  * Edit /etc/yum.repos.d/devlan.repo

file: devlan.repo
 baseurl=file:///iso/repo/dvd


Start by capturing the SSLSecure Socket Layer traffic in question. Search through the traffic until you find the Certificate for the Server Key Exchange.
    - In Wireshark's packet detail pane.    - Expand the SSLSecure Socket Layer protocol.    - Expand the Certificate in the TLSTransport Layer Security record.

    - Expand the Certificate handshake protocol.    - In the list of Certificates the first is the Server's Certificate and the second is its signing CA.    - Right click and select "Export selected packet bytes..."

    - Save the file. If you save it with the .crt extention then you can just use the Windows GUIGraphical User Interface to view the certificate.


Systems Internals strings tool is useful for dumping a files ASCII7-bit character set and UNICODE strings.  To do this for a large number of files its helpful to use batch processing.
for /f %i in ('dir /b') do \work\strings -n 3 -a %i > %i.ascii.txt-or- for /f %i in ('dir /b') do \work\strings -n 3 %i > %i.unicode.txt
