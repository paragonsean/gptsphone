Developer Testing
THOU MUST

Consider that we don't have beta testers. 
Test all components of your software.

THOU SHOULD

Write unit tests to assist with regression testing.
Test code components in isolation from other components.If components cannot be isolated, consider dependency Google Mock   or look into ways of modifying your design.

Utilize industry standard testing libraries like Google Test Library  , WinUnit, or PyUnit.
If manual tests are required, document what those tests are so future developers are aware
When writing tests, focus on "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"
Good - Expected values
Bad - Acceptable but extreme values
Ugly - Out of range values (does the function fail as expected)


Follow a consistent naming pattern for your tests

THOU SHOULD NOT

Test TRULY trivial code (think getters and setters)
Test non-deterministic code or write non-deterministic tests (think random numbers) (if you must, look into Google Mock   to abstract away what you are truly trying to test)


THOU MUST NOT

Consider the fact that compilation was successful as sufficient testing. 
Write your own unit testing framework
