Description of Source

ApolloThis is the music player app that is used to access the survey app

bcmThis is the wiFi driver that supports monitor mode for collection. 

bcmonThis is an app developed by the bcmon team. It dynamically patches the wifi driver to add monitor mode. The source was never released, so this is the "reverse engineered" source. This directory is purely for reference to potentially use for techniques/methods in the future. 

ics_mon_cleanThis is the source directory for the cyanogenmod os, containing the stock broadcom wiFi drivers.

ics_mon_dirtyThis is the source directory for the cyanogenmod os, containing the bcm wifi drivers (monitor mode). 

SurveyThis is the spottsroide app that conducts the survey and collection.
