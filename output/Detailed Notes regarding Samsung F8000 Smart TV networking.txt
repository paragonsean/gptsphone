SECRET // REL USA,UK
In developing a WiFi reconnect watchdog when TV enters Fake-Off mode, the following information was learned about how the TV is configured
Kernel Drivers
Two related kernel drivers

cfg80211 – module shown as loaded by lsmod and as a kernel thread by ps
ath6kl_usb – module shown as loaded by lsmod, depends on cfg80211, and shown as kernel thread by ps

Contents of /mtd_cmmlib/WIFI_LIB/QCA/WIFI_INIT_VERSION_INFO are:
WIFI:ATH6KL(3.5.2.14.0204)
 
Notable Files and Directories:
/etc/Scripts/wifi_restart.sh – calls /sbin/wifi_module_reset which is not yet fully understood
iwconfig and ifconfig utilities are present on the system
Network configuration parameters held in /mtd_rwarea/network/ directory

network_Wired_info – holds configuration for eth0.  configuration remains there even when wlan0 is the active interface
network_type_info – set to "CurrentType=0" for wired, or "CurrentType=1" for wireless
wpa_sta.conf – contains wireless configuration parameters for the wpa_supplicant.  Stores (last used) WPA passphrase in plaintext regardless of which interface is active.  Appears to be in standard wpa_supplicant configuration file format
entropy.dat – probably used with wpa_supplicant

/mtd_cmmlib/WIFI_LIB/QCA/ directory


iw – standard linux utility for interfacing with system's wireless networking.  Potentially useful commands:
iw wlan0 info
iw wlan0 scan
iw wlan0 get_average_signal



wpa_client – client for wpa_supplicant.  Potentially useful commands:
wpa_cli help
wpa_cli status
wpa_cli ping
wpa_cli list_networks
wpa_cli reconfigure
wpa_cli reassociate

wpa_cli reauthenticate

wpa_cli reconnect
wpa_cli enable_network 0


wpa_supplicant – daemon that handles wireless & WPA functionality


Experiments with Network Configuration Transitions:

Start: wireless connected, manually add IP to eth0 with ifconfig
eth0 keeps IP while powered on and while in Fake-Off
eth0 loses IP when TV powered back on


Start: wireless connected, use SmartHub to switch to wired
eth0 reconfigured using previously configured static IP address
wlan0 interface loses IP address
wpa_cli status => wpa_state=INACTIVE
wpa_sta.conf retains previous wlan0 settings and WPA credentials
wpa_cli list_networks => last network shown with ID = 0, but as "[DISABLED]"
Not certain all commands are required, but was able to re-active wlan0 with the following command sequence (this did not work in Fake-Off), but may if allowed to let the system settle more:
wpa_cli reconfigure (wpa_state changed to DISCONNECTED)
wpa_cli reassociate (wpa_state changed to INACTIVE)
wpa_cli enable_network 0
wpa_cli reconnect (wpa_state changed to COMPLETED, no IP)
wpa_cli reassociate (wpa_state stays COMPLETED, no IP)
udhcpc -i wlan0 -t 5 -T 5 -b (assigns IP to wlan0 interface and responds to pings)




Start: wireless connected, manually add IP to eth0 with ifconfig, enter Fake-Off
eth0 stays active with manually assigned IP (very useful for inspecting the system when in Fake-Off)
wlan0 interface deleted (shown with ifconfig -a)
wpa_supplicant continues to run in the background
udhcpc no longer running (it has been killed)
wpa_cli status => wpa_state=DISCONNECTED
wpa_cli list_networks => ID = 0 with flags of "[DISABLED]"
Could not find a sequence of ifconfig wlan0 up, wpa_cli enable_network 0, wpa_cli reconnect, wpa_cli reassociate, or wpa_cli reauthenticate that would bring up wlan0 into the needed wpa_state=CONNECTED.  wpa_state=4WAY_HANDSHAKE was common.
A process that did work was to kill/restart wpa_supplicant, and kill/restart udhcpc
An observation that was not fully verified – it seemed that when entering Fake-Off, the wlan0 interface is disabled twice.  Once right-away, and a second time 1-3 minutes later.  This was observed when manually reseting wlan0 immediately after entering Fake-Off.  Although it initially worked, the fix didn't stick as it seemed that something came along and disabled it again.  After reseting it a second time, the interface appeared to stay up for a long period of time.  Further diagnosis was not done since the solution should periodically check and reset.


Start: wireless connected, use SmartHub to disconnect from wireless (also not connected to wired)
wpa_cli status => wpa_state=INACTIVE
wlan0 retains IP address and displayed by ifconfig
