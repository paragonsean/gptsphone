('view-file' missing)
Furtive Syringe (bootstrapper)
needs to uninstall command if elinit fails.
Bootstrapper (FURTIVESYRINGE) Design  
Remote Exploitation with Persistence (on-disk)

use EVE to exploit browser
use SOL to break out of sandbox and escalate privileges
mount system partition as writable, 
fetch NightSkies, 
write to flash (dyonedo(fs))
add cdhash to trustcache
posix_spawn(furtivesyringe)


FurtiveSyringe
add NS.precore to trustcache
use launchctl api to set DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=NS.precore and reload locationdNew option is to use SAL instead of launchctl method to inject code directly into locationd.Caveats: hooks/interposing that depended on DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE can no longer be used, so to hook symbols, the implant / modules / whatever needs to use the gancho project.





NS dlopen()s its modules
interpose/hook notification to prevent gps pop ups
if launchctl'ed, use interposing
if sal'ed, use gancho to hook.



exit

Remote Exploitation without Persistence (in-memory)

use EVE to exploit browser
use SOL to break out of sandbox and escalate privileges
fetch NightSkies, write to memory
use SAL to inject NS pre-core into a process (locationd)
Map NS database into NS pre-core process
NS pre-core uses Machinjection to shootup() NS core from in-memory database
NS pre-core uses Machinjection to load NS modules from in-memory database into process
NS core uses machmessage to to IPCInterprocess Communications from locationd to other modules(CORE <--- ---> call audio module)
