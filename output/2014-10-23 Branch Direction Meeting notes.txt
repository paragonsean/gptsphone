Reference


Discussion of Branch Organization with User #71455

User #71459, User #71460, and User #71457 (also User #71458) will be relocated to ESD/CNB. 
Slots will likely be kept in EDBEmbedded Devices Branch (2 of 3)



Discussion of other potential options for reorganization with User #71455 (CNB, AIB, EDBEmbedded Devices Branch)



Potential Mission Areas for EDB


Firmware Targets

Internet of Things (e.g. Weeping Angel (Extending) Engineering Notes   )
Vehicle Systems (e.g. VSEP)
ICS/SCADA
Network Devices (including but not limited to SOHOSmall Office / Home Office routers)
EFI



Software Targets

Linux/Unix
BSD
Solaris
VxWorks - not addressed by any EDBEmbedded Devices Branch work
QNX - not addressed by any EDBEmbedded Devices Branch work, big player in VSEP



Software Capabilities

Exploitation
Access
Persistence
Network
Implant







"Advertising" the Branch

Do we have a flagship product? 
Do we need to define "embedded systems" for management and customers?
Technical:  A single-purpose device that has a firmware running a software operating system.

Non-technical:  A computer serving a singular function that doesn't have a screen or keyboard.

Really non-technical:  "The Things in the Internet of Things"






Discussion of need for generic implant for Linux-based Embedded Systems, applicable to future 

A flagship product to enable the branch to better position for operations
Working for subset of target platforms. Once a new/similar platform is encountered, effort is decreased to focus on important problems (e.g. access, persistence)
Address need to pre-position for future CONOPS/requirements like  Weeping Angel (Extending) Engineering Notes  



When do we seek customer buy-in?  How do we know what target platforms are seen day-to-day?   Perhaps when we have demonstrable capability, easier to ask "Where do you want us to go from here?" than "Where do you want us to start?"

Seek to develop modular "library" of capabilities to unify across platforms, require only necessary componentsMultiple solutions for individual capabilities
e.g. When providing stealth: kernel level, via process injection, or in plain sight ...
e.g. When providing persistence:  GRUB, initrd ... 







Discussion of Team development

Team consisting of entire branch (User #524297, User #11628962, User #524420, User #71384, User #20873326, User #3375130 )
Co-located in lab
Need for Collective Code Ownership - All members familiar with all parts of development



Some discussion of need for Working Agreement – for future:  

Mapping Values to Work - Scrum Values (excerpt from http://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum/core-scrum-values-roles) ?
Focus - Because we focus on only a few things at a time, we work well together and produce excellent work.  We deliver valuable items sooner.
Courage - Because we work as a team, we feel supported and have more resources at our disposal.  This gives us the courage to undertake greater challenges.
Openness - As we work together, we express how we're doing, what's in our way, and our concerns so they can be addressed.
Commitment - Because we have great control over our own destiny, we are more committed to success. We strive to deliver what we promise.
Respect - As we work together, sharing successes and failures, we come to respect each other and to help each other become worthy of respect.
