                        Simulating Packet Delay / Dropped Packets
Packet Delay
To simulate packet delay, use the 'tc' (Traffic Control) command:
sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay ____ms
To delete current tc commands:
sudo tc qdisc del root dev eth0
 
Drop Packets
To simulate corrupted packets, use the command: (change the probability as desired)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.01 -j DROP
 
To list iptables rules:
sudo iptables -L --line-numbers
To remove an iptable rule: (replace <index> with the line number provided from the list in the command above)
iptables -D INPUT <index>

Would love to see more developers test their tools over high latency links.  Could easily automate a test environment for this using either Vagrant or Docker.
