An operation file should be referenced for searching, post processing, and configuring
 
UI functionality:
Find drives for them when post processing (automate as much as possible)
Report Status of Post Processing Drives
Collection Directory opened for them
Separate Triage Into Categories
Summary Sheets for surveys
Prepare the drive for them (formatting and all)
 
Potential Initial Set Of Execution Vectors:
VLC Player
Irfan View
Portable PSPs (ClamAV, Kaspersky Anti-RootKit, McAfee, etc)
Backup Software
Document Viewer
Note Taker
Portable Browser
Portable Mail Viewer
2048, Sudoku, something else
Portable cmd replacement - CMDER
Sandisk Vault or U3 software

Kill Date of 6 months from deployment?
What if the target wants a copy of the application? - Self-Delete If Not Run From Volume
