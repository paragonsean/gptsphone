The development environment is using Apache ANT (1.9.2) to build and manage all the sub projects.  Each tool/feature is located in a separate directory and contains a unique solution.  To begin development, edit the “properties.ant” file located in the root of the project.  Ensure that all tools exist and the appropriate paths are included within this file.  It is also possible to disable specific platforms by setting x86_supported or x64_supported to “false” instead of “true”.  The following build commands are supported by the ANT scripts.
