Making life less painful with PyCharm
For those of you using gedit or similar to write you dart scripts there is a better way.  I was searching for a decent IDEIntegrated Development Environment for Python on Linux and stumbled upon PyCharm.  I've found this IDEIntegrated Development Environment to be pretty nice, and with a little tweaking it allows for you to auto complete Dart methods.
Step-by-step guide
To make life better, do the following1:

Install PyCharm2

Create a new Python project and set it up to have the correct leafbag structure.
In PyCharm select File -> Settings -> Project Structure
On the right of this window you should see "Add Content Root", add the following3:
~/Dart/tybase201408/src
~/Dart/tyutils/leafbag
~/Dart/tyworkflow201408/src


Create a new python script which will be your main leaf
Add the following code so that you can auto complete the host object:

 
#This should seem familiar because it is required for all leafs
import tybase.undermine.leaf as leaf
import tybase.undermine.meta.leafi as leafi
 
#This is a hack to allow us to enumerate the host object
import tybase.palantir.client
import tybase.undermine.client
 
#Back to the familiar
@leafi.MainLeaf()
class MyAwesomeTest(leaf.Leaf):
	def run(self):
		host = self.hosts[0]
		
		#this finishes the hack
		assert isinstance(host, tybase.palantir.client.Client)
		assert isinstance(host, tybase.undermine.client.Client)
 
Doing these steps will allow PyCharm to autocomplete a lot of the Dart methods, furthermore User #1179755 found that if you hit Ctrl+Q you can get any documentation they have on said method (hit or miss if they have any).  Good luck and happy coding.
 

1: This article assumes you have already setup your machine to have tybase, tyworflow, and tyutils pulled down.
2: PyCharm is made by the JetBrains guys and can be found at their website, or you can download PyCharm Community Edition v3.1.3 (which I am using for this how to) from \\fs-01\share\Linux\utilities
3: This is assuming we created our repos in ~/Dart/, this could be something different on your machine.
