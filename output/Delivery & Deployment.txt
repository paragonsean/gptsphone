Integration & Acceptance Testing
THOU MUST
Assist IV&V in developing a solid test plan for your product.
THOU SHOULD

Consider the (below) Rule of Eight when planning automated testing."If the test will ever be run more than eight times, it is worth the effort spent to automate it."

Consider that if two components are dependent on each other, that an automated test to verify that they work together as intended may be necessary. 
Consider if DART can meet acceptance testing needs for your project.

THOU SHOULD NOT
Be shy about writing automated acceptance tests as a project developer.  They can be of great utility to IV&V. 
THOU MUST NOT
Treat "Release Candidates" as "Betas".   Confidently deliver a release candidate that you know is a quality product.
