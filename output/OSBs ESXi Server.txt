OSB's ESXi Server
Overview
There are 5 classes of VMs running on this machine:
Infrastructure (INF) - These machines are meant to support OSB's vlan or do other similar things.  They are NOT meant to be used in testing, only log into them if you know what you are doing.
Utility (UTL) - These machines are shared machines like the snowcrash VM, they are not meant to be used for testing purposes and are simply a shared resource.
Listing Posts (LPSListening Posts) - These are many different LPs, meant to be shared and made available for testing, but are not test vm's (i.e. don't try and break them).
Bamboo (BMB) - These servers are out automated build servers, or vm's that support them, don't mess with them.
Test (TST) - These are the machines you are looking for, all are joined to the domain for the most part and should be kept up to date (They won't have PSPs installed by default).  Use them, play with them, break them, but when you are done revert them to a clean snapshot.
We are on the honor system here, so work with your fellow OSBers on what is available.
Naming Convention
ESXi doesn't let us organize VMs in folders so we need to follow a strict naming convention so we don't confuse ourselves.  This convention will be as follows:
<CLASS>_<OS>_<ARCH>_<APPS OR DESCRIPTION>.
So for example, a test VMVirtual Machine running Windows 7 and Office 2010 will be (TST_WIN7_X86_OFFICE2010).
Accessing the VMs

Connect directly to the VMVirtual Machine either via RDPRemote Desktop Protocol or SSH
Connect to the ESXi Server through VMWare – File->Connect To Server (Probably the best way)
Connect to the ESXi Server through VCenter – https://osb-vcenter.devlan.net (Login with DEVLAN credentials... Must be DEVLAN\username
Connect to the ESXi Server through VSphere – Download the VSphere client on the share and connect directly to osb.devlan.net using DEVLAN credentials (\\fs-01.devlan.net\Windows Applications\VMware)
