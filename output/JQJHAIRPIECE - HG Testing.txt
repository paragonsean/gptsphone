JQJHAIRPIECE - ROCEM TESTING
Testing Summary

JIRA issues from ROCEM JQJADVERSE testing that were observed again for JQJHAIRPIECE
ROC-2 - Exiting interactive ROCEM session produces SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol trap

ROC-3 - Log messages observed on tac_plus /var/log/syslog server during ROCEM interactive session

ROC-6 - If DUTDevice Under Test configured to log config changes to syslog, config changes made through ROCEM logged with no username

ROC-8 - Effects of ROCEM user commands logged to syslogs
ROC-9 - ROCEM telnet connection with no username visible in "show users" output


Telnet user rx unexpected privilege level when ROCEM set whlie telnet user at Username: prompt - ROC-10
ROCEM unset command produces SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol Trap - ROC-11

Testing in support of JQJHAIRPIECE
"This release is for hairpiece-1r. hairpiece-1r is released as a part of ROCEM 1.1.
Target: hairpiece-1
Platform: 2960S IOSApple operating system for small devices Version:   
c2960s-universalk9-mz.122-55.SE8"
Operator confirmed that the will just use ROCEM for survey at this point, in interactive mode.  Potentially will use ROCEM later to throw HG.
Misc. Test Notes:

SE7 and SE8 IOSApple operating system for small devices on the box, need SE8 for testing. Changed system boot, unable to load SE8. Deleted SE7 from the switch, reload, successfully loaded SE8.
Test Infrastructure Information:


Target Switch - 2960S-MgtSW / IP Address 192.168.21.2
VMs 
ICON1-UbuntuDesktop12.04_x64-LTS 172.20.12.22 - Command and Control
scd-proxy - scripting telnet session (JQJHAIRPIECE-log)


Solar Winds Network Management - 10.9.8.22
AAA Server 10.9.8.25


Smoke Test - Survey with ROCEM
2960S is configured to log snmp traps and syslogs to Solarwinds (hairpiece-1r)
2960S is configured to use AAASecurity Server from Cisco server for telnet sessions
Executed ROCEM per readme - sudo ./rocem_c2960s-universalk9-mz.122-55.SE8.py -i -f fill.bin 192.168.21.2

Output of "who" command before ROCEM shows my console session and my vty session on line 1:
2960S-MgtSW#who Line User Host(s) Idle Location 0 con 0 root idle 00:03:11* 1 vty 0 root idle 00:00:00 10.9.8.96 2 vty 1 idle 00:00:09 172.20.12.22
Followed Hairpiece-1r readme procedure to use ROCEM to execute show commands


./rocem_c2960s-universalk9-mz.122-55.SE8.py -i -f fill.bin 192.168.21.2
Entered y to proceed
2960S-MgtSW# prompt appeared - no creds were entered
Executed show commands from readme successfully. No log entries showed up from performing a "show log," no SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol entries seen on Solar Winds.  No commands were logged to AAA.
Entries were logged on AAASecurity Server from Cisco server in /var/syslog at start and end of ROCEM session - ROC-3Jul 13 08:39:54 ubuntuserver tac_plus[1223]: connect from 172.31.255.2 [172.31.255.2] Jul 13 08:39:58 ubuntuserver tac_plus[1234]: connect from 172.31.255.2 [172.31.255.2] 
Output of "who" command shows ROCEM vty session from ICON-CT IP and no username - ROC-9

Typed exit at ROCEM prompt - session closed, no logs generated, however  SNMP trap for the connection close is logged: loctcpConnOutBytes.192.168.21.2.XX.XXX.XX.XX (???).22.54605 = 78  loctcpConnInBytes.192.168.21.2.XX.XXX.XX.XX (???).22.54605 = 847  loctcpConnElapsed.192.168.21.2.XX.XXX.XX.XX (???).22.54605 = 0.50 second  tcpConnState.192.168.21.2.XX.XXX.XX.XX (???).22.54605 = synReceived(4)  tslineSesType.2.1 = telnet(5)  snmpTrapOID = CISCOTRAP-MIB:tcpConnectionClose  sysUpTime = 23 hours 15 minutes 19.24 seconds - ROC-2




Ad-hoc test - Login to DUTDevice Under Test while ROCEM interactive session is active
Established ROCEM interactive session
Attempted to login to DUTDevice Under Test on console using AAASecurity Server from Cisco creds
Attempted to login on console as root/password - rcvd expected password prompt and priv 15
Attempted to ssh in as root/password and telnet in as root/password and rcvd expected password prompt and priv 15
This behavior differs from the JQJADVERSE ROCEM delivery where EAR 4684/ROC-4 was observed.



Ad-hoc test - Login to DUTDevice Under Test while ROCEM set
Set ROCEM
Attempted to login to DUTDevice Under Test on console - immediately granted priv 15 access 
Attempted to telnet in with root/password and was immediately granted priv 15 access
Attempted to ssh in with root/password and was prompted for creds as usual
All behavior reverted to normal when rocem was unset
Note that SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol Trap is produced when ROCEM is unset - ROC-11
No trap is produced when ROCEM set
This is all expected per Operator Use Notes



Ad-hoc test - Establish ROCEM interactive session while telnet user at Username prompt:
Telnet to DUTDevice Under Test and wait at Username prompt
Establish ROCEM interactive session

Was prompted for credentials as expected

Exited that telnet session and opened a new one -was pompted for creds as expected
Same results repeated for user on console instead of telnet



Ad-hoc test - Set ROCEM while telnet user at Username prompt.
Telnet to DUTDevice Under Test and wait at Username prompt
Set ROCEM
Entered root/password at prompt on console- was only granted priv 1 acces
Entered root/password at prompt in telnet session - was only granted priv 1 access

Could not enable for either console or telnet session because the credentials were not accepted: ROC-10 2960S-MgtSW>enPassword:% Error in authentication.

Unset ROCEM and behavior remained the same until the telnet session at priv 1 was exited and I made another attempt to login, at which point behavior reverted to normal.  This is not expected behavior based on Xetron's Hairpiece ROCEM QRC Results which state that:Set ROCEM while a user is at the telnet username promptAAA - Proper credentials are still required by the open telnet session.  During this test case, proper credentials are not accepted.  Telnet user rcvs unexpected privilege level, seems similar to EAREnterprise Archive 4684 which describes unexpeted privilege level recevied while ROCEM interactive session active.


Ad-hoc test - Logging for non-ROCEM telnet session while ROCEM set
Establish telnet session to DUTDevice Under Test and verified that AAASecurity Server from Cisco is logging
Set ROCEM
Perform show commands from exsiting non-ROCEM user and verified that AAASecurity Server from Cisco does not log show commands
Logged out from existing telnet session and did see AAASecurity Server from Cisco log a disconnect: root, tty1, 10.9.8.96, stop, disc-cause-ex=9
Logged back in whlie ROCEM set, ran show commands, then disconnected - AAASecurity Server from Cisco commands were not logged, nor any start/stop messages. 
Logged back in while ROCEM set, ran config changes, then disconnected - AAASecurity Server from Cisco commands were not logged, nor any start/stop messages, or SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol traps, however a syslog message was printed to console screen and syslog:Jul 13 18:09:20: %SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console by vty0 (10.9.8.96)
Unset ROCEM and then entered a show command in existing telnet session, and it was logged to AAA.


Ad-hoc test - Logging for non-ROCEM telnet user during ROCEM interactive session
Establish telnet session to DUTDevice Under Test and verified that AAASecurity Server from Cisco is logging
Establish an interactive session to DUTDevice Under Test with ROCEM
Perform show commands from existing non-ROCEM user and verified that AAASecurity Server from Cisco does not log show commands
Perform show commands from ROCEM user and verified that AAASecurity Server from Cisco does not log show commands
Logged out from existing telnet session and did see AAASecurity Server from Cisco log a disconnect: root, tty1, 10.9.8.96, stop, disc-cause-ex=9
Logged back in whlie ROCEM interactive mode still active, ran show commands, then disconnected - AAASecurity Server from Cisco commands were not logged, nor any start/stop messages.
Logged back in whlie ROCEM interactive mode still active, ran config changes, then disconnected - AAASecurity Server from Cisco commands were not logged, nor any start/stop messages, or SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol traps, however a syslog message was printed to console screen and syslog:Jul 13 18:43:37: %SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console by root on vty0 (10.9.8.96)
Logged back in with telnet user and confirmed AAASecurity Server from Cisco logs not being generated.  Then disconnected ROCEM interactive session.  Entered show commands in existing telnet session and they are now logged.


Ad-hoc test - Fill up VTY lines while ROCEM interactive session is active
Filled up all VTY lines
Attempted to set, unset and establish interactive ROCEM session - all attempts failed, but with no log message, trap or other alerting behavior.
Exited one telnet session to free up a vty line for ROCEM
Established ROCEM interactive session, then attempted to establish one more telnet session - telnet session refused, however no log message, trap or other alerting behavior.
Exited ROCEM interactive session and then set ROCEM.  
Attempted to telnet to device successfully, but subsequent attempts after vty lines fill up fail.  No log message, trap or other alerting behavior.


Ad hoc test - SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol traps generated during ROCEM interactive session
Established ROCEM interactive session
Bounced an interface via ROCEM session as well as through non-ROCEM session - no traps produced
Closed ROCEM interactive session
bounced interface through existing non-ROCEM session - traps produced.
Observed output of show snmp and trap PDUs increased whlie traps were not rcvd by SolarWinds.  This is expected based on Operational Use Notes that a config change through ROCEM interactive session will still generate an SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol entry.


Ad hoc test - SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol traps generated while ROCEM set
Established telnet session with DUT
Set ROCEM
From existing telnet session as well as through new session after ROCEM set, bounced an interface to attempt to produce a trap - no trap observed
Unset ROCEM and repeated commands to bounce interface through existing telnet session - traps observed


Use IACInternational Access Code with ROCEM to throw third party tool
Set ROCEM
Attack with IACInternational Access Code for HG aquaman-5h delivery
We only have HG delivery for 2960-S for a slightly different code version, so I thought I'd try this test, however we also only have sshiac and not iac for that delivery of HG.


Ad-hoc test - reload DUTDevice Under Test using ROCEM
Established an interactive session to DUT
Entered reload through ROCEM session
Jul 14 11:56:09: %SYS-5-RELOAD: Reload requested by vty0 (172.20.12.22). Reload reason: Reload command - log message with no user listed as entering the command, just vty0
No other alerting log messages or SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol traps
After reload, I was able to log in normally to DUTDevice Under Test using AAASecurity Server from Cisco root/password creds.
