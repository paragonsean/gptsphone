Gotcha – that's a lot more clear.  For this one it may not matter, I don't anticipate a v2.0 at this time, but I guess we'll burn that bridge when we get there.

Hmm... you are right...  not what was intended. Will modify.  
My point was that if you are severing history, then you should create a new repo.  
If you are not, then it should remain in the same repo and you should use tags. 
 
To be fair, it also says under DON'T:
Incorporate version numbers into your Stash project names or repositories

Wait... I thought having a separate repo for every version under the project was recommended?  Stash Project DOs and DON'Ts seems to imply that...
When starting a new version or full rewrite of an existing project, make a new source repository  for it located in the existing project.
I currently use tags for released versions numbers and release candidates, so I can separate out v1.0 from, say, v1.0.1 or v1.1.
v2.0 would get its own repo.

Use of version numbers in Git repository names are not recommended!  (Reason being, it's not specific enough).
Use Git tags for tracking version numbers, as a tag will be directly associated with a specific commit hash object.
