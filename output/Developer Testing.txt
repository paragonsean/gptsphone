Source Control
 
THOU MUST

 Use source control, and agree on a Git Workflows   with your team.
Ensure delivered revisions are properly tagged

Ensure all projects under source control can be built after checkout.
No need to seek guidance from the developer
No code modification to make it work
External dependencies are ok, but must be well documented



THOU SHOULD

Use Git for source control (it is an industry standard, and has good support on Windows).
Use Stash as your primary remote (called origin by default)
Maintain two long-lived branches (see Git Workflows  )

master - Officially delivered code (always stable, tagged versions).

develop - Stable branch from which development is based.


Focus development work into short-lived branches that implement specific requirements (e.g. features, bugfixes, hotfixes, release planning) (see Git Workflows  ).
Limit the number of developers who can commit to develop and master (because things can and will go wrong if you don't).
Manage merging of code into develop and master via pull requests.


THOU SHOULD NOT

Commit directly to master (or develop), or use the "Centralized" workflow
Maintain a source control repository (Git or otherwise) entirely disconnected from Stash.


THOU MUST NOT
Consider "source control" to be multiple copies of your source being saved to FS-01.
