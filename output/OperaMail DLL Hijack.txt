OperaMail DLL Hijack
Procmon screenshot:

MSIMG32.dll worked fine, as for other apps.  One thing to note: the DLLDynamic Link Library stays loaded for the life of the process
\app\operamail\

Side Note: it looks for "operamail.dll" adjacent to itself, before properly finding it (\app\operamail\).  The DLLDynamic Link Library exports only 6 functions, and may be easily reversed if needed later...
