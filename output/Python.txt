I ran across a system that didn't have a python 2.7 that worked with shellterm (it complained about pydebug or something)
 
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev libncursesw5 libncursesw5-dev libbz2-dev libgdbm-dev liblzma-dev tk-dev valgrind
tar zxvf Python-2.7.x.tgz
cd Python-2.7.x
./configure --enable-shared --enable-loadable-sqlite-extensions --enable-ipv6 \
            --with-system-ffi --with-system-expat --with-signal-module --with-threads --with-valgrind \
	        --with-fpectl --with-ensurepip --enable-unicode=ucs4
make && make install
