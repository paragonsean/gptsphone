Description: 
Fight Club is an umbrella crypt for the set of tools provided for the JQJINDISCREET QRC effort. For this effort, COGComputer Operations Group requested a prioritized development in which trojans would be built to drop and install Ricky Bobby 3.0. The trojans would be spread across 6 thumbdrives intended to be inserted into the supply chain of a target network/group. Upon opening any of the weaponized applications, the Ricky Bobby 3.0 would becom installed on the machine. This is a configured Ricky Bobby 3.0. Ricky Bobby is persisted via scheduled tasks. 
 
COG provided the following prioritization of applications for trojaning: VLCMediaplayer Player, Win-Rar, TrueCrypt, ConnectifyMe, Shamela Reader, Microsoft Office Standalone Installer, Adobe Reader Installer. EDGEngineering Development Branch was able to supply the following trojans in the operational timeline: VLCMediaplayer Player, Win-Rar, TrueCrypt, Shamela. The six thumbdrives sent to the field for operational use had 4 self-extracting Win-Rars (Wraith), 2 VLCMediaplayer players, 2 TrueCrypt applications, 2 Shamela applications.
