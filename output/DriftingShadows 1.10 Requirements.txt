DriftingShadows 1.9 Requirements
SECRET//NOFORN
 
 
('details' missing)
Goals
Create a DriftingShadows version that will have a builder so that differently configured payloads can be attached to the DLL.  The LNK file will kick off a 64-bit DLLDynamic Link Library which will check for the existence of Kaspersky, check for the existence of a stop file, and will have a list of whitelisted IP addresses to target.  If those checks clear then it runs a 32-bit DLLDynamic Link Library that does process hollowing on a 32-bit svchost.exe and then injects GRAVITYTURN into that process's space.
Assumptions

User has access to a shared network drive that all of the targeted IP addresses will visit.
The target systems are 64-bit machines.

Requirements
Delivered File Requirements:


ID
Status
Task


27
complete
A LNK file that is pointing to the location of the 64-bit DLLDynamic Link Library to start up the process. (Will point to the location of tmpD24A.tmp.)


28
complete
A 64-bit DLLDynamic Link Library (tmpD24A.tmp)


29
complete
A 32-bit DLLDynamic Link Library (tmp5A12.tmp)


30
incomplete
A command-line builder to attach the 32-bit GRAVITYTURN payload to the 32-bit DLL


Configuration Requirements:


ID
Status
Task


31
complete
Be able to add the payload to the DLL


32
complete
Be able to configure the filename for the stop file that will be located at %TEMP% on the exploited systems


33
incomplete
Be able to give a file of whitelisted IP addresses, and if there is nothing then leave it empty


64-bit DLLDynamic Link Library requirements:


ID
Status
Task


34
complete
Check for Kaspersky running on the system


35
complete
Check for the existence of the stop file (will re-exploit if the stop file name changes between different GT deployments)


36
incomplete
Check if there is a list of IP addresses to filter against, if not then get everybody, if so then check the user's IP against the list


37
complete
Call rundll on the 32-bit DLL


32-bit DLLDynamic Link Library requirements:


ID
Status
Task


38
complete
Unpack the GT payload


39
complete
Use the process hollowing from User #? to inject that payload into svchost.exe
