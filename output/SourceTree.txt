Using PackageIO
fs-01.devlan.net/share/MDB/OSX/Software/FreeSoftware/Editor/Sublime/Installed Packages/Package Control.sublime-package
PackageIO is a package manager for Sublime plugins. You can install it manually by dropping it into the Installed Packages folder in:

~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Installed Packages (iOS)
/.config/sublime-text-3/Installed Packages/ (Linux)

NOTE: Restart Sublime Text after dropping the package file.
It's likes going to the internet for everything, but I've managed to get individual packages installed on devlan:

By default, PackageIO has one "channel", which it uses to figure out what packages are available. You can remove this channel and add additional ones by
cmd + shift + p (Linux: shift+ctrl+P), type remove channel, press enter, and select the default channel

Add a new channel by cmd + shift + p, type install channel, press enter, and at the bottom prompt, add http://mdbtest.devlan.net/channel_v3.json as the new channel URLUniform Resource Locator(alternatively, download the json file at https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json)





now the install packages option can be selected:s

The packages themselves are hosted all over the place, so here's where this process breaks - you have to either
fake the url (Sublime checks certs) or
edit the channel_v3.json (or ask mdbtest owner nicely) to change the URLUniform Resource Locator of the package you want to somewhere on devlan. A nice idea would be for someone to pull every package known by package control and host them somewhere.



 
 
 
Ananconda Settings
Some useful ananconda settings
Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> Ananconda -> Settings (User)
{
"pep8_ignore": [ "E128", "E203", "E221", "E251", "E302", "E501", ], "anaconda_linter_mark_style": "none", "anaconda_linter_underlines": true,
}
Sublime Tips
You can search using regex, limiting to specific file types:

 
 
Configuring How Files of <insert your extension here> Are Interpreted By Sublime 3
 

Open the file of the extension you wish to configure(i.e. open a mycustommake.mk)
On the lower right-hand corner, click on the current file type(probably says plain text)

select "Open all with current extension as ..."

Select the new file type handler
