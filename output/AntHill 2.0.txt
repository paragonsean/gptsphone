Common Gotchas and Limitations
Creating recursive directories
You must create directories recursively manually if required, CreateDirectory[W/A] are the only available functions
Checking if path exists
Use GetFileAttributes[W/A] for checking for the existence of a file/directory rather than using PathFileExsts, etc.
