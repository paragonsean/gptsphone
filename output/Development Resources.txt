PyPi
 
I have a PyPi server on 10.2.3.96 on port 8080. That machine also includes a samba share for the Python packages, so you can upload your pypi packages there.
On an internet-facing machine, you can use the pip2tgz command to download a pypi package and its dependencies.
You can edit your ~/.pip/pip.conf file:
 
[global]
index-url = http://10.2.3.96:8080/simple
trusted-host = 10.2.3.96

Agree - the other confluence page had an out of date IP address for the pip server, so I made my own. Ideally, IBInfrastructure Branch should set this up for us with a proper DNSDomain Name System entry.

There's already a simple pip sever on 10.6.2.20. We should probably avoid duplicating efforts.
