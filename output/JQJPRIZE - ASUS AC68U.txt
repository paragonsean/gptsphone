cppcheck analysis
 
Ran: ~/cppcheck/cppcheck-1.68/cppcheck --template=gcc --enable=all --force client/ common/ server/ util/ 2> ../../../cannoli_v2.0_cppcheck.txt
Ignored results that were in open source code - e.g. md5, nc, untar
Ignored "style: The scope of the variable X can be reduced"

client/client_lib.c:158: portability: scanf without field width limits can crash with huge input data on some versions of libc.already opened CAN-2


client/client_lib.c:734: error: Uninitialized variable: tlsh
used as dest to read(), could have a situation where it's not completely filled and then invalid values are at the end
probably should be checking that sizeof(struct tls_header) bytes were read after do while() is done


server/server.c:325: warning: %d in format string (no. 1) requires 'int' but the argument type is 'unsigned int'.same for other fprintf() calls 

server/server.c:622: style: Variable 'n' is assigned a value that is never used.technically should be checking n before testing value of res

server/server.c:670: error: Read and write operations without a call to a positioning function (fseek, fsetpos or rewind) or fflush in between result in undefined behaviour.there's a call to fscanf two lines above


server/server.c:628: error: Memory pointed to by 'bconn' is freed twice
free() on line 603; condition should never happen, cppcheck prob doesn't parse pthread_exit() to know the function returns

server/server.c:320: error: Uninitialized variable: tlshsame as above in client_lib.c

util/CCT/CCT_Core.hpp:82: performance: Function parameter 'filename' should be passed by reference.sure
