Check for PSP Detection
This article aims to give an overview of how to ensure a payload dropped to a DARTTest-Software (commercial) VMVirtual Machine is not detected by a Personal Security Product (PSPPersonal Security Product (Anti-Virus)).  The article assumes the reader is familiar with DARTTest-Software (commercial) in general and will instead focus on specifics related to the PSPPersonal Security Product (Anti-Virus) scripts located in the EDGEngineering Development Branch leafbag.
