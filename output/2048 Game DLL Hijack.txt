2048 Game DLL Hijack
This is a silly game... it even has a "floppy 2048" mode that I got a good lol out of
Procmon screenshot:

2048 seems to love "D3dCompiler_46.dll" which doesn't exist anywhere... returning FALSE from PROCESS_ATTACH is no problem
 
"dbgcore.DLL" is loaded and kept for the life of the process.  This is an ideal DLLDynamic Link Library though, as the function prototypes are documented on MSDN

English only
