Linux ARP Options
Information on this page is taken from Benvenuti:Understanding Linux Network Internals, O'Reilly Media, 2006, p708-711.
Tunable ARPAddress Resolution Protocol Options are found under /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf
ARP_ANNOUNCE - controls which source IP addresses can be put in the ARPAddress Resolution Protocol headers of solicitation requests.


Value
Meaning


0 (default)
Select any local IP address


1
If possible, select an IP address that falls within the same subnet of the target address; otherwise use level 2.


2
Prefer primary addresses.


Â 
ARP_IGNORE - controls the criteria that determines how to process ARPAddress Resolution Protocol requests
The IP addresses in Linux belong to the host, not the interfaces. Consequently, ARPAddress Resolution Protocol requests will be processed by a host as long as the target IP address is configured on ANY of the interfaces, including the loopback (lo) interface. This behavior, however, can be modified by changing the ARP_IGNORE parameters found under /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf.


Value
Meaning


0 (default)
Reply for any local address.


1
Reply only if the target IP address is configured on the receiving interface.


2
Like 1, but the source IP (sender's address) must belong to the same subnet as the target IP.


3
Reply only if the scope of the target IP is not the local host (i.e. that address is not used to communicate with other hosts).


4-7
Reserved.


8
Do not reply.


>8
Unknown value; accept request.
