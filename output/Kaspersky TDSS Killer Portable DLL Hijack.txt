Kaspersky TDSS Killer Portable DLL Hijack
The following is a screenshot of a selected number of DLLDynamic Link Library misses from Kaspersky TDSS Killer Portable:

Although \app\TDSSKiller\ui\SwDRM.dll is a miss for the Portable splash EXE, placing a DLLDynamic Link Library here odes not result in code execution.
Â 
"SHFOLDER.dll" will load and can return FALSE from PROCESS_ATTACH, "riched20.dll" and "version.dll" require function forwarding
