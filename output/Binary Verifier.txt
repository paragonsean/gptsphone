If this cc_fips_test is pointing to unsigned binary or a binary that return non-success, then it will power off the device. This will cause the device to become "soft bricked".
 
This is a procedure to verify cc_fips_test will be in a good state.
1. ssh into device
2. cd /usr/libexec/
3. ls -al cc_fips_test
4. ls -al .cc_fips_test
5. If cc_fips_test is NOT a link and has a size around 34224, then you are good.
    ex. "-rwxr-xr-x 1 root wheel 34224 Oct  7  2014 cc_fips_test"
6. If cc_fips_test is a link lets fix this.
    6a. Is .cc_fips_test have a size around 34224. 
        i. If it isn't around that size, you will have to recover cc_fips_test from a backup.
    6b. mount filesystem read writable
    6c. cp .cc_fips_test cc_fips_test
    6d. mount filesystem read only
