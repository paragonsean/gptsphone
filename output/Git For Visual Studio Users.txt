FYI, the GITSource code management software for Windows link is pointing to the wrong file.  I got VS2012.2.exe when I downloaded it.

Completely agree.  I think that pointing to a folder on the share will be the best "go-to" place for the latest.  I wish the share wasn't such a landfill though. It could use some serious purging.  Attaching stuff here should be a good temporary measure to get folks started on trying it out.

Just a thought... might be more beneficial to link to something like "file:///fs-01/share/Windows Software Development Resources/git" rather than uploading to Confluence. I can't see how uploading versions of git tools to Confluence would scale very well.
