Progress / Notes

TR team has performed initial review of configuration and Ops provided diagrams
TR team is moving required VMs at this time
Created Blot-Proxy, Blot-Onslaught, Blot-CoverWeb, ICON-CutThroat VMs.  Copied Fedora10-hg2960-Seeds VMVirtual Machine from NDBNetwork Devices Branch Lab to use for seed traffic.
Built test network with 2960S-24TS-L target switch, 3750G-24T Router and 3 2960-24TT-L switches.
Upgraded IOSApple operating system for small devices on target 2960S switch to c2960s-universalk9-mz.122-55.SE7.bin.  Updated confiugration to match config obtained from COG.
Uploaded Aquaman delivery package to ICON-CutThroat VMVirtual Machine and installed in /home/ubuntu.
Successfully attacked target 2960S switch with SSHIAC and installed Hun-Grrr. Note:
On ICON-CutThroat VMVirtual Machine - had to move to Devlan temporarily to download the ia32-lib from the repo in order for SSHIAC to run
Must enable the root account and su - root in each window you use when you attack with SSHIAC and use CutThroat


Modified Seeds scripts on Fedora10-hg2960-Seeds VMVirtual Machine to generate ICMP/ARP, DNSDomain Name System and HTTPHypertext Transfer Protocol traffic in our test network.
Working on getting comms up between Hun-Grrr and ICON-Cuthroat VM.
IXIA added to the topology for traffic generation. Port 11 on IXIA to 0/1 on 3750 and IXIA Port 20 to 2960S 1/0/24
Re-configured topology based on latest 2960 configs from BARTWELL
