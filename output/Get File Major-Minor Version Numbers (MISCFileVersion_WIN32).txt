Miscellaneous Module
Stash Repository: Miscellaneous Library

Module Name: MISCIsUserInAdminGroup_NET (Uses NET APIApplication Programming Interface)
 
Module Description: This module use a process ID (PIDProcess ID) to identify a specific user (Domain\user). The module then uses the derived domain and user names to obtain the privilege level as specified by the Net User APIApplication Programming Interface (NetUserGetInfo - USER_INFO_1). The module will tell you if the specified user is a part of the Administrators group.
 
Usage: 

/*
	Determines whether the user the code is currently running as is a member of the administrators group
*/
static BOOL IsUserInAdminGroup(DWORD dwPID);

 dwPID [in]: The process ID from which to derive the user and group level. Pass in GetCurrentProcessId() to determine if you are running in the context of a user who is a part of the Administrators group.
Returns TRUE if the specified user is a part of the Administrators group and FALSE if not. 
 
PSP/OS Issues: No Known Issues
 
('excerpt' missing)
 
Sharing Level: Unilateral
 
Technique Origin: In-house (well-documented Windows APIApplication Programming Interface)
 
Notes: 

This module will only tell you about the user associated with the process specified
If the PIDProcess ID is different from the PIDProcess ID of the current process, you must make sure that the passed PIDProcess ID can be opened with QUERY_INFORMATION access rights

 
Module Return Codes: 
Returns TRUE if the process's User is a member of the Administrators group. Returns FALSE if the process's user is a member of the user or guest groups.
 
Example Code:
 
//Determine from a separate process's PID
DWORD dwPID = 7320;
BOOL bRet = MISCIsUserInAdminGroup_NET::IsUserInAdminGroup(dwPID);


//Determine from our own PID	
bRet = MISCIsUserInAdminGroup_NET::IsUserInAdminGroup(GetCurrentProcessId());
