vSphere Web Client Slow to Open Consoles
If the vSphere Web Client is slow to open VMs in a console, perform the following to speed it up.
The main cause is due to the fact that the vCenter server is using a self-signed SSLSecure Socket Layer cert.  When a request is made, Windows tried to update it's own root certificates by connecting to a Microsoft server.  You can turn off automatic root certificates update to stop this from occuring.
 

Click Start -> Run.
Type gpedit.msc, and then click OK.
Under Computer Configuration, select Administrative Templates -> System -> Internet Communication Management -> Internet Communication settings.
Double-click "Turn off Automatic Root Certificates Update".
Select "Enabled", and then click OK.
