We should probably copy or move these pages over to the AEDApplied Engineering Devision Tradecraft space.  There's not a lot of overlap so I think many of these could be moved as-is

Ideally, I'd even like to see an AEDApplied Engineering Devision Tradecraft space with offshoots into subtopic areas like these.  Heck, I'll create one right now.

Just FYI, I have some similar stuff out of OSBOperation Support Branch that I am cataloging for PSPPersonal Security Product (Anti-Virus) avoidance.  Maybe we should combine our powers, Captain Planet style?
