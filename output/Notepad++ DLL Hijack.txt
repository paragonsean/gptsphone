Notepad++ DLL Hijack
The following DLLDynamic Link Library hijack works for both the portable and non-portable variants of Notepad++
 
Notepad++ loads Scintilla, a "code editing component" (and seperate project), from a DLLDynamic Link Library adjacent to its EXE called "SciLexer.dll".  This DLLDynamic Link Library exports only one funciton named "Scintilla_DirectFunction" at ordinal #1
 
The DLLDynamic Link Library does a lot of "set up" in ProcessAttach, so it is important to load the true DLLDynamic Link Library as soon as the hijack is loaded.
 
The exported function has the following prototype definition, according to the open source for Notepad++ online:
sptr_t __stdcall Scintilla_DirectFunction(ScintillaWin * sci, UINT iMessage, uptr_t wParam, sptr_t lParam)
 
For the life of me, I couldn't get this function to be called – I even installed additional plugins that were supposed to interact with Scintilla directly.  Considering we have the prototype, this shouldn't be that big of a deal, but its worth noting.
