                        Enabling OS X Updates on Devlan
We are regularly syncing OSOperating System X updates to towerpower.apple.net.  Here's how you set your system up to receive them:
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL http://towerpower.apple.net:8088/index.sucatalog
On devlan, the App Store won't work, but you should start receiving notifications about updates automatically.
Manually Applying Updates
If you don't want to wait for your system to look for updates, you can manually apply them, as follows:
# show all updates for your system
sudo softwareupdate --list
 
# install recommended updates
sudo softwareupdate -irv
 
Restoring Default (apple.com) Updates
You can stop receiving updates from towerpower.apple.net by removing the CatalogURL:
sudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL
