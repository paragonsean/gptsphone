The Cisco 2911 Config has both GRE configured and VPDN (pptp) configured.
To use pptp, connect from a Windows machine using the VPNVirtual Private Network utility and use the cisco credentials to authenticate the VPN.
The "Attack VMVirtual Machine Network Config.txt" is just used if wanting to establish a GRE tunnel. It is not used for pptp.
