Magical Mutt v1.0 Sprint 2 Retrospective 2016-02-24

Retrospective



What did we do well?

Code reviews went well and were effective in finding issues
Fleshed out most of the structure that will drive the rest of development

User #14588054 found the setting to get default reviewers onto our pull requests
Effectively used JIRAUser Managment Software (Atlassian) issues in the commit messages to track development



What should we have done better?

User #71473 seriously messed up the repository and it had to be recreated.




What will we do differently next time to improve?
When creating a project with the wizard it is important to let the wizard create the main project folder and do the initial push. Â Nesting a new solution inside an empty GITSource code management software repo causes major issues
