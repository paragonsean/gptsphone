The System Monitoring and Manipulation Library is a set of classes designed to be used in two main scenarios:

Go/No Go logic for installers/droppers (i.e., blacklist or PSPPersonal Security Product (Anti-Virus) avoidance).  Immediate feedback at the time the member function is called
Event notification/Change Detection

As an example, an implementation of the library would provide both on-demand process detection (is procmon.exe running now) and event driven call-back notification (alert me when procmon.exe starts or stops).  This is not primarily intended for collection purposes, but rather to alter program behavior based on current system state or future events.

Interface Description: The interface for the System Monitoring and Manipulation Library specifies on-demand detection of machine state using the Contains, DoesNotContain, IsEqual, IsNotEqual, IsLessThan, IsLessThanEqual, IsGreaterThan, IsGreaterThanEqual logic functions. The prototypes are as follows:
 
Library Conventions: 
Naming convention of classes in the System Monitoring and Manipulation library:

Prefix SM (System Monitoring)
Type of system object or state to monitor + the word "Monitor" (e.g., "MediaMonitor", "ProcessMonitor", "RegistryMonitor")
_ Optional crypt specifying APIApplication Programming Interface basis of technique, abbreviated to 2-3 letters (W32 = Win32 API, WMIWindows Management Instrumentation = WMI, MFC = MFC, PSX = Posix-style calls)

 
Example:
SM_MediaMonitor_W32
SM = System Monitoring and ManipulationMediaMonitor = Class to monitor removable/fixed media_W32 = Implementation based on Win32 APIApplication Programming Interface for core functionality
 
System Monitoring Member List:

SM_NetAdapterMonitor_W32 - Class Name: SM_NetAdapterMonitor_W32

Code Sample Using The Library Interface:
// NetAdapterMonitor Examples
 
SM_NetAdapterMonitor_W32 netMon;
if (netMon.check(SM_NetAdapterMonitor_W32::SM_OP_EXISTS, SM_NetAdapterMonitor_W32::SM_TYPE_IP_ADDRESS, L"10.2.8.8|10.2.8.64") == ISystemMonitoring::eSM_TRUE)
{
	wprintf(L"This system has IP 10.2.8.8 or 10.2.8.64 assigned to an adapter\r\n");
}
else
{
	wprintf(L"This system DOES NOT have IP 10.2.8.8 assigned to an adapter\r\n");
}
 
if (netMon.check(SM_NetAdapterMonitor_W32::SM_OP_DOES_NOT_EXIST, SM_NetAdapterMonitor_W32::SM_TYPE_MAC_ADDRESS, L"12:34:56:78:90:AB") == ISystemMonitoring::eSM_TRUE)
{
	wprintf(L"This system has an adapter with MACApple Operating System 12:34:56:78:90:AB\r\n");
}
else
{
	wprintf(L"This system DOES NOT have an adapter with MACApple Operating System 12:34:56:78:90:AB\r\n");
}
