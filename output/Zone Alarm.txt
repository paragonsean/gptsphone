Neat. 
FYI - I think there is a recent-ish (11-DEC-15) article making the public rounds which mentioned a lack of ASLRAddress Space Layout Randomization usage by some PSPs.  Might be interesting to skim the DLLs & such of the PSPs & see which support DEP, ASLR, and/or SAFESEH...
FYI x2 - I think Tavis Ormandy from Google has published some material in this area as well.
