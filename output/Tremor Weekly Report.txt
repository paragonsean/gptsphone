Goals

Post-notification, New edit : The first goal is to test how version control works. Is it lock-based? Merge-based? What happens if someone else edits this document while I'm editing it?Adding addition information to this page <-- What is this line?
Post-notification, Another edit : The second goal is to see how often the draft is being autosaved, and see if that plays into version control //JBG
Post-notification, 3rd edit : The third goal is to see how autosaves push out to other editors. //JBG

Post-notification, Last edit : I added a fourth goal //JBG
