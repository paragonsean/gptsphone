Retrospective



What did we do well?

We lost 2.5 days to snow/weather, seemed to handle it ok.
Was able to pull in separate stories by a little bit of luck w/r/t SQLAlchemy stuff on backend.
Customer Involvement/follow-up/comms was really good (particularly w/r/t reqs)



What should we have done better?

developed weather control tech
still need a better model to express stories whose completion depends upon outside forces.




What will we do differently next time to improve?
