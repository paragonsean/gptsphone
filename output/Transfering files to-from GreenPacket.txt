Transfering files to/from GreenPacket
File transfer to/from the GreenPacket is very limited. 
To get files onto the router

host the files on a webserver and use wget from the router to pull them.
use tftp (no ftp)

 You can't use scp to send files/to from the router (no scp binary). 
The router has nc but it has no listen function.  So you can use nc to send files from the router to another machine but not receive.
