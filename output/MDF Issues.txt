Mount Network Share
In Finder, hit Command-k to bring up the "Connect to Server" dialog box. Enter "smb://fs-01.devlan.net" for the "Server Address". Select the "share" volume and hit "OK". Enter your devlan credentials when prompted for a username and password. Once "share" is open in Finder, bookmark the "MDB" folder since you will need access to it often.
Set Up NTP
Go to the Date & Time preferences, check the box for "Set date and time automatically", and enter "ntp.devlan.net" for your time server.
Install Xcode
Install Xcode from smb://fs-01.devlan.net/share/share-udb-net/public/osx/software/Xcode.
Do not forget to install the command line tools.
After Xcode is installed, "fix" it.  from command line type "open /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS.sdk/SDKSettings.plist" and double click to switch from NO to YES and YES to NO the following fields:

ENTITLEMENTS_REQUIRED = NO
CODE_SIGN_REQUIRED = NO
AD_HOC_CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED = YES

Check to see if additional .../Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS<version>.sdk directories exist and fix their SDKSettings.plist as well (This is required for XCode 6.3).
IRC
Install Adium from share. Follow the instructions at Internet Relay Chat (IRC)   to set up an IRCInternet Relay Chat client. Join the rooms #mdb and #mdb-ios.
Messages/Bonjour
The iOS team uses Apple's Messages application to communicate due to its cleaner handling of multi-line messages. To set up Messages,

Launch the Messages program.
Select "Preferences" from the "Messages" menu.
Click on the "Accounts" tab.
Click on "Bonjour".
Check "Enable Bonjour instant messaging".

Configure Your Bash Profile
$ touch ~/.bash_profile 
export PATH=${PATH}:/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/:~/GIT/git-repo/
export EDITOR=vim  # designates editor for input when a command line tool requests an editor
export CLICOLOR=1  # command line color set
export LSCOLORS=dxfxcxdxbxegedabagacad    # LS command line color set
 
#The following are GITSource code management software command line completions (optional but suggeted
. /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/share/git-core/git-completion.bash
. /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/share/git-core/git-prompt.sh
GIT_PS1_SHOWUNTRACKEDFILES=1     #... untracked files(
PS1='\u@\h:\W\[\033[31m\]$(__git_ps1 "(%s)")\[\033[0m\]\$ '


# The following are Make file completions suggested but optional
 
_complete_make() { COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "$(make -pRrq : 2>/dev/null | awk -v RS= -F: '/^# File/,/^# Finished Make data base/ {if ($1 !~ "^[#.]") {print $1}}' | egrep -v '^[^[:alnum:]]' | sort | xargs)" -- "${COMP_WORDS[$COMP_CWORD]}")); }
complete -F _complete_make make
 
export CODESIGN_ALLOCATE=$(xcrun -f codesign_allocate)   # used by the coding command needs to know where coding alloc is located in Xcode
export ZOO_IPSW_PATH=~/Work/ios-files/   # used for make files and IOSApple operating system for small devices build processes
export GHIDRA_PATH=~/Work/ghidra_6.0.10     # used for make files and IOSApple operating system for small devices build processes
Either log out and log in again or source .bash_profile as needed.
Set Up SSHSecure Shell key pair
Using ssh-keygen, create a private/public key pair:

$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (~/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
...

Set up Stash
On Stash (stash.devlan.net), go to "Manage Account" under the user menu icon on the upper right (it may have a non-image display). On the left, navigate to "SSH Keys," and then click "Add Key." On the command line, type:
$ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
This copies the key into the bin. Paste it into the text field on Stash and click "Add Key."
Configure SSH
Open (or create) ~/.ssh/config and add the following:

host stash
        hostname stash.devlan.net
        port 7999
        user git

SSH will determine your username from the key you created. Test this by checking out a
project from git (try "git clone  ssh://stash/dto/dto_logger").
Set Up .gitignore_global
Create the file ~/.gitignore_global with the following list of file names for which GITSource code management software should ignore changes:

 
.svn/
*.build
build
build-*
DerivedData
.DS_Store
*xcuserdata*
*.xccheckout
*.pyc
*.orig
*.dSYM
*.swp
*.o
NOTE: Older versions of GITSource code management software might use ~/.gitignore. Run "git config --global --get core.excludesfile" to check what file is being used if you have issues.
Set up Git Config
Useful git aliases to add to your ~/.gitconfig:
 
[core]
    excludesfile = /Users/<your_user_name>/.gitignore_global
[alias]
    b = branch
    ca = commit --amend
    ci = commit
    co = checkout
    f = fetch --all --prune
    gui = !sh -c '/usr/local/git/libexec/git-core/git-gui'
    po = push origin
    st = status --short --branch
    lg = log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr)%C(bold cyan) <%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit
 

Install Repo
Create a folder in ~/GIT for git-repo
from GITSource code management software run "git clone ssh://stash/gitrepo/git-repo.git"
Test Repo checkout
$ mkdir early$ cd early $ repo init --no-repo-verify -u ssh://git@stash.devlan.net:7999/ios/early_manifest.git$ repo sync
Fix Xcode
Run the following commands to disable code signing and entitlements and to enable ad hoc code signing. The script also creates a link to IOKit.
$ git clone ssh://stash/ios/xcode_fixes.git
$ cd xcode_fixes; python fix_xcode.py $(xcrun --sdk iphoneos --show-sdk-version)
Add Entries to Hosts File
The JIRAUser Managment Software (Atlassian) and PyPi servers are not currently registered with our DNSDomain Name System servers. Manually add them to your hosts file. See lines 10 and 11.
##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost
172.31.1.2      jira.ioc.local jira
10.2.3.102      pypi.python.org
Install GHUnit
git clone ssh://git@stash.devlan.net:7999/ios/gh-unit.git
cd gh-unit/Project-iOS
make default
sudo make install

Create Stash Pull Requests From the Command Line (moved to stash page) 

We’ll be continuing to improve these tools, some improvement in the pipeline include:

Allow the user to set the title and description of a PR
Pulling out a pull request description from the commit message body
Checking that the source branch is fully pushed to the server, and providing an option to do so if not
Create a host of new commands, such as:

Listing all/my pull requests for the current repo
Switch to the source branch for a particular repo (so that I can review the code with my local clone)


However, we need you! If you’re a ruby wizard and use Stash, fork the project on Bitbucket and create a pull request to contribute back. You can be awesome too!
