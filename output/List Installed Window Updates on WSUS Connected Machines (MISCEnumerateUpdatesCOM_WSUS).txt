Miscellaneous Module
Stash Repository: Miscellaneous Library

Module Name: MISCUserAccessControlLevel_WIN32 (Uses Windows Registry APIApplication Programming Interface)
 
Module Description: This module determines the current UACUser Account Control (User Account Control) setting on a machine. The module scans the registry for two registry keys that are associated with the UACUser Account Control Level as controlled by the user. The UACUser Account Control level ranges from 1 to 4 where 1 is UACUser Account Control off and 4 is the highest UACUser Account Control setting. This module only works for Vista+ machines as XPWindows operating system (Version) does not use UAC. 
 
Usage: 

/*
	This function determines the current UACUser Account Control level on the machine. The function returns the level in a range from 1-4. Returns
	FALSE on failure and TRUE on success. dwLevel is considered an invalid level if dwLevel == INVALID_UAC_LEVEL (-1)
	
	1 = UACUser Account Control Turned Off
	2 = UACUser Account Control Low Setting
	3 = UACUser Account Control Medium Setting (Default Win7)
	4 = UACUser Account Control Highest Setting
*/
static BOOL GetUACLevel(DWORD &dwLevel);

 dwLevel [out]: Returns the level of UACUser Account Control as described by the machine settings 
Returns TRUE on success and FALSE on failure. The dwLevel is returned with a value of INVALID_UAC_LEVEL (-1) on failure.
 
PSP/OS Issues: Vista+ (Fails gracefully on XPWindows operating system (Version)).

Sharing Level: Unilateral
 
Technique Origin: In-house (Windows APIApplication Programming Interface Calls - Specific Registry Keys)
 
Notes: 

This module only checks registry settings is not a result of reverse engineering UAC. If UACUser Account Control ignores these settings in some cases (not yet seen), this module could be unreliable.
Vista+

 
Module Return Codes: 
Returns TRUE on success and FALSE on failure.
 
Example Code:
 
//Get the current UACUser Account Control level
DWORD dwLevel = 0;
BOOL bRet = MISCUserAccountControlLevel_WIN32::GetUACLevel(dwLevel);


printf("Current UACUser Account Control Level: %d\n", dwLevel);
