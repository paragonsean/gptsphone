StrawHat 1.0 Requirements
SECRET//NOFORN
('details' missing)
Goals
Collect just the text from .DOC/.DOCX, .XLS/.XLSX, .PPT/.PPTX files (with potentially more file types in the future) and recreate them as best I can on the post-processor side.  Give the operator the ability to select which file extensions (s)he wants to collect.
Background and strategic fit
Because CakeShoulder seemed like it could be made so much sweeter with some fine tuning and customization.
Assumptions
Right now I am currently working under the assumption that all targets that are going to be using this tool have the IFilter functionality on their computers.
