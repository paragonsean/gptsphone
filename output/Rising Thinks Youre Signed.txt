F-Secure Entropy Defeat
UPDATE: Another technique seems to work fine for both F-Secure and Avira.  Cloning the manifest from a self-extracting RARFile compression algorithm file seems to make both of these annoying troublemaker PSPs happy.  The resource type for the manifest is 24, the resource number is 1 and the resource language is 1033.  
Note: This technique does cause issues with Kaspersky when used with Snowcrash.  Proceed with caution and test, test and retest:

Old Technique Follows:
F-Secure, not unlike Avira, seems to strongly dislike binaries that contain large sections of high entropy data. Unfortunately, the Rar! trick doesn’t fool F-Secure. However, it seems F-Secure is doing a different, but equally brain dead static string scan to see if an otherwise “dangerous” file is a totally legit Rar self extractor – it looks for strings contained in the string table resource of a RARFile compression algorithm SFX.
Plop this RC file into your binary with Visual Studio or Reshacker, or use Clone resources on a sample self extracting RARFile compression algorithm file.
NOTE: While this technique seems to work swimmingly against F-Secure, it makes Avira pitch a fit.  More research is needed to see if there is a way to defeat both F-Secure and Avira at the same time.
