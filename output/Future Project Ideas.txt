Why


Hive Rewrite
Embedded Linux
Network Redirection Implant

Redesign for modularity
Provide ability to develop automated test framework



Tbot Rewrite

Provide ability to develop automated test framework
Provide ability to incorporate new features easily (eg. IPv6, application layer obfuscation)



CherryBlossom Rewrite
Embedded Linux
Wireless Access Point Implant

Contractor-provided source base difficult to maintain/reproduce development environment
Wireless access/collect functionality still relevant to customer
