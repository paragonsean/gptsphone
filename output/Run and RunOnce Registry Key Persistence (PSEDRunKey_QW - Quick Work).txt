SECRET//NOFORN
 
OSB Library: Persistence

Module Name: PSEDSchedTask_TP (TrickPlay)
 
Module Description: This module creates a scheduled task. When installing persistence with user privileges this modules sets the trigger to run a command at logon of the current user (as the current user). If running as Administrator or SYSTEM, the scheduled task is set to run as SYSTEM on system startup. The tasks are identified by the task name. This module uses COM for Task Scheduler 1.0 (works XP+). This means, however that all tasks have the same destination folder (Task Scheduler Library). If this module is used often it should be considered to change some parameters (such as start date) so that a signature is not built on the module.
