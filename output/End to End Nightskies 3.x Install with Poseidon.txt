Agency
 

EDG = Engineering Development Group - group making tools for COG; based on the 8th and 9th floors of DD2
AED = Applied Engineering Division - part of EDG
MDB = Mobile Development Branch - iOS and Android team working in the cage; part of AED

iOS Team Projects and Tools and Vulnerabilities/Exploits

Adderall = tool to pull IPSW files and kernel cache from devices
Angerquake = Mission Control for Android
Aquarius = contract for creating an implant
CrunchyLimeSkies = close access tool to install (persistent or not) an executable onto a device.nsinstaller is the main project

dyld-js = JavaScript code to load dylibs and other binaries; needs exploits that give it memory access and ability to call native functions
Dyonedo = generates a dylinker/executable pair to defeat code signing and launch a payload
Earth = array.sort vulnerability in JavaScript (pre iOS9)used by mcp_earth and elderwaldorf projects

ElderPiggy = privilege escalation
Grist = JavaScript bootstrapper that can be run with jsc
HAMR (pronounced hammer) = throwing framework for browser exploits
contracting effort with QUAFFLE run by ESD(Branch) and based on MissionControl to throw against OSX, Linux, and mobile devices (basically anything except Windows)

existing EDGEngineering Development Branch throwing framework was Windows based and did not work well with these platforms



jit-thunk = JavaScript code to make calls to native functions using JIT memory and memory access exploits; implements the native_call interface; made for use by Grist to persist on device
js-util = JavaScript utilities including the testing framework, DataView, and additional String and ArrayBuffer methods
jsc-util = generic JavaScript utilities related to the JavaScript Core; includes memory access functions and configuration for specific iOS versions including structure offsets and sizes
Juggernaut = project of exploits used by the Grist framework
Mcnugget = Mission Control for iOS
mcp_adam_ios = mission control plug-in to determine whether 32 or 64 bit
mcp_earth = mission control plug-in for Earth exploit (see Earth)
mcp_eve = mission control plug-in to do initial exploitation for code execution
mcp_safari_ua_ios = mission control plug-in to parse user agent
mcp_sol = mission control plug-in to send stage 1 loader (installer) to devices
MOP = Mach-O Parser - Python project to parse Mach-O files (soon to be called Apple Binary Parser (ABP) and maintained by HONEYDEW)
Nandao = privilege escalation (privesc) and sandbox escape for iOS7 and iOS8
NightSkies = beacon/implant tool (maintained by AQUARIUS based on the MDBMobile Development Branch created tool of the same name)
NightVision = utility to read kernel memory and get/put files as .tbz
Quaffle = support contract for the Hammer throwing framework
Redux = close access tool for reading/writing executing files/memory via vpnagent. Should work on iOS up to 8.1.1.
rop-thunk = JavaScript code to make calls to native functions using ROP; implements the native_call interface; meant for remote browser exploits
Xiphos = privilege escalation (privesc) for iOS7, needs to be paired with a sandbox escape when run from remote.

iPhone Stuff

IPSW = iPhone/iPad Software - firmware for the devices
MDF = Mobile Development Framework - public tool providing Python bindings
jsc = JavaScript Console - JavaScript interpreter on iDevices. Used for persistence by the Grist program. Located at /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework/Resources/jsc. Not really used by Apple any more and may be removed in a future release.

Other

Networks
DevLAN = classified development network used by MDBMobile Development Branch and others
ZooLAN = old unclassified network; this is why you will occasionally see "zoo" or people with animal names


JQJ* = tag given to names of operations
pyzzle = Python executable zip file
