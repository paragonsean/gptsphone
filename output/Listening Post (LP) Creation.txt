Background
In DNSDomain Name System terminology, a domain is referred to as a 'zone'.  Each zone has its own zone file which defines hosts and IP addresses for its respective zone.
Add a new host to a Zone

Edit the file /etc/bind/db.<domain name>.For example, if the zone is loki.lab, the file will be /etc/bind/db.loki.lab.

Once all edits are complete, check the zone file by issueing the command:
$ sudo named-checkzone <domain name> db.<domain name>
For example, "sudo named-checkzone loki.lab db.loki.lab


If there are no errors, reload BIND.$ sudo service bind9 reload


Create a new Zone

Edit the file /etc/bind/named.conf.localCreate a new zone section and point to the zone file "/etc/bind/db.<domain name>.  Note: The actual zone file will be created in the next step.For example, if the zone is loki.lab, point to the file /etc/bind/db.loki.lab".


Create a new zone file by copying db.local for the new domain name.
For example, if creating the zone loki.lab, execute the command "sudo cp db.local db.loki.lab".
Edit the zone file by adding new hosts (Follow the instructions in the section titled "Add a new host to a Zone")
