Perseus 1.1.0
Test Approach

Long Term Test

Setup RB450 with Perseus installed.  Take baseline and let it run, periodically taking memory/CPU "snapshots".
Have a VMVirtual Machine running HTTPHypertext Transfer Protocol Seed.
 


 
MIPSBE
DUT1 (RB493G) and DUT2 (RB450) are connected together via a LAN-side interface running RIP between them.
192.168.88.0/24 will not route between DUT1 and DUT2 because each of these devices has that same subnet configured on an internal interface.
192.168.0.4 is running HTTPHypertext Transfer Protocol Seed traffic to 172.20.11.104.
