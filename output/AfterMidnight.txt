                        My First Gremlin
This is my workspace for my experiences turning Drone in to a Gremlin.

Forked drone in to its own DroneGremlin Project
Created DroneGremlin(Init|Command) functions and added them to the def file as NONAMES
Copied Gremlin.h from SDKSoftware Development Kit to projectCommented out #include "NTDLL.h" because Windows.h covers all that and I didn't grab NTDLL.h

(optional) Created empty (for now) DroneInterface structure that contains a GremlinInterface as its first member
Init command just fills out pointers and returns 0, Command just debugs out what's going on
Link against Master.lib (from DevKit, presumably) - this gives access to MasterCommand()
Build drone.dll
run "ToolTest DEBUG_MOD drone.dll" - should get called

Order of calling is:

Init() function called
Command() called with ID_OPEN
Command() called with ID_RUN (if runable (tbd))
... time passes ...
Command() called with ID_CLOSE

For Drone:

Init()Do nothing

ID_OPEN()Ensure DRONE_INTERFACE is initalized

ID_RUN()??? (maybe nothing, maybe call ID_CONNECT or something)

ID_CONNECT()Drone specific code - create a thread, store handle in DRONE_INTERFACE, and do the drone callback

ID_CLOSE()If a thread is running, get it to exit, then return
