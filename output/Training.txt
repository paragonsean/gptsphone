Switch Config Baseline
Committing Config Changes
All of the switch configs are saved into RANCID's CVSSource code management software repository.  They can be viewed at http://rancid.testrange.local/viewvc/HG-Training/configs/
If a switch's config is updated, it needs to be updated in RANCID.  RANCID will not automatically pull the config since we only want certain changes to be committed to CVS.
To commit switch config changes to RANCID, perform the following steps:

SSH to the RANCID server as the ubuntu user.
Go to /home/ubuntu
Run the command: sudo -i -u rancid /usr/local/rancid/bin/rancid-run HG-Training
You should now see a new revision in CVSSource code management software (if there were changes).  You can view the latest config or diff from the previous config by going to http://rancid.testrange.local/viewvc/HG-Training/configs/


Reverting Config Changes
After each training session, each of the switches will be reverted back to their baseline by pulling the config from RANCID.  This is done using a shell and expect script which accesses the switches via the console server. 
The scripts can be run using the following steps:

SSH to the RANCID server as the ubuntu user.
Go to /home/ubuntu/restore_training_switches
sudo ./restore_hg_training_config.sh
