Change Author Details of All Commits in a Git Repository
For when you realize you have been making commits as user@localhost for the past three weeks.
Step-by-step guide

Add the steps involved:

Edit the following script with your details, and run it while in your repository:
#!/bin/sh
 
git filter-branch -f --env-filter '
OLD_EMAIL="old-email@example.com"
CORRECT_NAME="Your Correct Name"
CORRECT_EMAIL="your-correct-email@example.com"
 
if [ "$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL" = "$OLD_EMAIL" ]
then
    export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$CORRECT_NAME"
    export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$CORRECT_EMAIL"
fi
if [ "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" = "$OLD_EMAIL" ]
then
    export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="$CORRECT_NAME"
    export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="$CORRECT_EMAIL"
fi
' --tag-name-filter cat -- --branches --tags


 
This forces (the -f option) the overwriting of any backup entries in refs/original. If this is important to you (and you understand what this means) then don't run this script.

Ha. I just went through the pains of figuring this out on my own, then looked on the internet to confirm (found a cleaner way). I should have actually looked here first. +1 User #524297.
Yeah def don't do this on repos with errant commits you've pushed to and co-workers sync with... unless you really want to make your co-workers hate you.
