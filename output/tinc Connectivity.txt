tinc by example
A Sample tinc Setup

In this setup, we have three hosts; the goal of this configuration is so that host1 can communicate with host3 within the private network via host2.


host1has an IP address that is accessible from host two


host2Is within a private network, but can reach host1 via UDPUser Datagram Protocol on port 665 (the default tinc port)


host3Within the same private network as host2 and can communicate with host2



Configuration Overview
The default configuration for tinc on linux is in /etc/tinc/<network_name>/, where <network_name> is a user provided name for the tinc network. Within this directory you have the following:


hosts/<host config>A subdirectory hosts that contains files describing the host configuration and public key for every host in the <network_name>. Should be the same on all machines


tinc.conftinc configuration for <network_name>


tinc-upA shell script for bringing up the tinc tunnel interface


tinc-downA shell script for bringing down the tinc tunnel interface


rsa_key.privThe private RSAEncryption algorithm key for the local host


Sample Configuration Data


network name
mynet


Host 1 VPNVirtual Private Network IP
10.0.0.1


Host 2 VPNVirtual Private Network IP
10.0.0.2


Configure tinc on host1


Create directories for configuration
mkdir -p /etc/tinc/mynet/hosts

Create /etc/tinc/mynet/tinc.conf 
Name = host1
AddressFamily = ipv4
Interface = tun0
Mode = router


Create RSAEncryption algorithm keys
tincd -n mynet -K4096

Edit /etc/tinc/mynet/hosts/host1, prepending the following (before the RSAEncryption algorithm key) 
Compression = 9
Address = 10.3.2.90
Subnet = 10.0.0.1/32


Create /etc/tinc/mynet/tinc-up
#!/bin/sh
ifconfig $INTERFACE 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.0.0.1


Create /etc/tinc/mynet/tinc-down
#!/bin/sh
ifconfig $INTERFACE down


Make the tinc-* scripts executable
chmod a+rx /etc/tinc/mynet/tinc-*


Configure tinc on host2


Create directories for configuration
mkdir -p /etc/tinc/mynet/hosts

Create /etc/tinc/mynet/tinc.conf 
Name = host2
ConnectTo = host1
AddressFamily = ipv4
Interface = tun0
Mode = router


Create RSAEncryption algorithm keys
tincd -n mynet -K4096

Edit /etc/tinc/mynet/hosts/host2, prepending the following (before the RSAEncryption algorithm key) 
Compression = 9
Address = 192.168.1.143
Subnet = 10.0.0.2/32
Subnet = 192.168.1.0/24


Create /etc/tinc/mynet/tinc-up
#!/bin/sh
ifconfig $INTERFACE 10.0.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0


Create /etc/tinc/mynet/tinc-down
#!/bin/sh
ifconfig $INTERFACE down


Make the tinc-* scripts executable
chmod a+rx /etc/tinc/mynet/tinc-*


Run tinc

Make sure the host1 and host2 configuration file within /etc/tinc/mynet/hosts are copied to both machines so both files are available on each host
Start tincd on host1 
tincd -n mynet -D -d3


Start tincd on host2
tincd -n mynet -D -d3
