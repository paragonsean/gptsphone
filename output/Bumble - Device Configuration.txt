Bumble 3.1 Test Notes
Test Summary

Downloaded and installed COGComputer Operations Group ICON Debian 8.1 image. 
CT 2.7 which was delieved is compatible with current ICON image.
MTU settings
CT MTUMaximum Transmission Unit setting can not go below 120 bytes.
Egress from Atk setting delaysim MTU<=108 and CTCounter Terrorism MTU<128 allows CTCounter Terrorism to connect, but states "currenct packet size restrictions are incompatible with selected Score protocol".
Ingress to Atk MTU<=508Bytes.


Score requires a minimum MTUMaximum Transmission Unit of 480Bytes for return traffic (from implant to CTCounter Terrorism).  
Flux will not be used with this tool so it will not be tested with flux.

Configure transtable aging time to 1 second: tp filter -t 1
From Atk: wget --output-document=- http://XXX.XXX.X.XX (GB)Response should be from Bumble webserver #3 - XXX.XXX.X.XX (GB)


Add redir rule: redir create 192.168.254.6 255.255.255.255 0 0 XXX.XXX.X.XX (GB) 255.255.255.255 0 0 any XXX.XXX.XX.X (EU-MAP-5[US]) 0 XX.XX.XXX.XX (EARTHLINKBUSINESS-BLK[US]) 0 0 -en

Fill up transtable by running the "enterprise" profile on the Ixia.  Also add a survey rule: tp survey create 192.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0 tcp -en
Check if redir still functions correctly: wget --output-document=- http://XXX.XXX.X.XX (GB)

Response should be from Bumble webserver #4 - XX.XX.XXX.XX (EARTHLINKBUSINESS-BLK[US])

To futher confirm, check transtable using the command "tp showtrans" and take a snapshow of the first 10 entries.
Wait 10 seconds and check the transtable again.  Compare the first 10 entries with the snapshot you took.  The entries should be unique.  With the ixia running, enough entries should be created in a few seconds to cause the transtable to cycle.

Successfully tested with Bumble 3.1 on 10/30/2015  (w/o latency).


Swiffer - Log Suppression
Reboot DUT, install implant, establish comms via CT.Insure swiffer is inactive:  tp swiffer show

Telnet to MSR and issue these commands:
display this
display users
display tcp
display logbuffer reverse
display history-command all
These commands should appear in the logbuffer and history command


Activate swiffer at the CTCounter Terrorism prompt
tp swiffer activate
tp swiffer show


At the MSR console and telnet prompt:
Confirm info-center is disabled:  display info-center
display clock
display ftp client source
display interface brief
display ip routing-table


At the MSR console, issue thes commands
Confirm there was no console message about the user connecting via telnet
Confirm recent commands were not logged to log buffer:  display logbuffer reverse
Confirm recent commands are logged to history:  display history-command all
Disabling the info-center will not disable the command history logging.  This is the reason for a snapshot of the history command file to be saved.  The saved history file will overwrite this history when Swiffer is deactivated.
This will also disable logging if a target admin issues commands.  There is no way to distinguish who is issuing the command.




Deactivate Swiffer using CT.  Deactivating Swiffer restores the snapshot to the command history
tp swiffer deactivate
Wait 5 seconds and confirm swiffer is deactivated:  tp swiffer show


At the MSR console and telnet prompt, confirm logs were removed
display logbuffer reverse
display history-command all



Successfully tested with Bumble 3.1 on 10/30/2015  (w/o latency).


Swiffer - automatic deactivation
At console: reset logbuffer
ICON: Note the time using the 'date' command
ICON: tp swiffer activate -t 300
Wait 10 seconds
ICON: tp swiffer show  should be activated

ICON: telnet 192.168.168.5
ICON: display info-center
ICON: dis this
ICON: dis users
At console: dis ip int brief
At console: display history-command all
display logbuffer reverse
Wait until 5 minutes have expired.
Ensure logs have been removed and swiffer deactivated
At console: display history-command all
At console: display logbuffer reverse
ICON: tp swiffer show should be inactive

Redir - Disable all rules then re-enable all rules
Disable all redir rules:  redir disable 0

UDP packets appear normal
Most TCPTransport Control Protocol appears normal.Telnet connections cause a lot of red to appear, likely due to the unreliability of the connection (delay sim is running).  Telnet connections also receive a RSTReal-time Transport Protocol from the MSR periodically.  It seems the MSR (server) issues the RSTReal-time Transport Protocol packet to close the telnet session.

Operator Notes

Do not use survey and redirection at the same time.
Disabling logging (using swiffer) will also disable logging for a target admin.swiffer will not hide telnet connection from "show users" output.

Commands execute while swiffer is enabled will not be removed from the history (dis history-command all) until swiffer is deactivated. They will not appear in the log buffer at all (dis logbuffer).  Info-Center will also be disabled as long as swiffer is active.  If info-center is re-enabled (ie. by an admin), commands issues via telnet will appear in the logbuffer (dis logbuffer reverse).  It will not appear in the 'dis history-command all' output.
Add TP note about using Nmap with Score.
How do we clear a kernel exception log should one occur?
Once swiffer is stopped, it can not be restarted unless you re-install PBD.
"comsn" on the MPU and "telnetd" on the SPU are the swiffer process.  If swiffer is removed, the PBD remains installed but these processes will no longer appear.  Swiffer is required to us the "tp savetrans" command.
